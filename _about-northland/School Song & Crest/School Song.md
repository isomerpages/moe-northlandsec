<p>We have a dream to be upright and strong,
<br>in our Nation proudly stand,
<br>imbued with spirit brave to build,
<br>the future of our land.</p>
<p>To Northland we come in hope to lay,
<br>the foundation of our dreams today.
<br>Here day by day like steel we lay
<br>the lessons of our youth.</p>
<p>Of timely moves and timeless truths,
<br>and values still unchanging,
<br>in duty strive undaunted,
<br>for nation and for school!</p>
<p>Responsible and Resolute,
<br>In Northland we grow,
<br>Responsible and Resolute,
<br>from triumph to triumph we go!</p>
<p>Responsible and Resolute!
<br>From triumph to triumph we go!</p>
