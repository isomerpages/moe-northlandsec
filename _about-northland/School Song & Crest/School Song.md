<p>We have a dream to be upright and strong,<br />in our Nation proudly stand,<br />imbued with spirit brave to build,<br />the future of our land.</p>
<p>To Northland we come in hope to lay,<br />the foundation of our dreams today.<br />Here day by day like steel we lay<br />the lessons of our youth.</p>
<p>Of timely moves and timeless truths,<br />and values still unchanging,<br />in duty strive undaunted,<br />for nation and for school!</p>
<p>Responsible and Resolute,<br />In Northland we grow,<br />Responsible and Resolute,<br />from triumph to triumph we go!</p>
<p>Responsible and Resolute!<br />From triumph to triumph we go!</p>
