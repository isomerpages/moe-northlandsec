Our students took a trip down memory lane and witnessed how they have grown from boys to men and for the ladies; from girls to young ladies. Our School Leaders and Year Head also congratulated our graduates and exhorted them to continue learning and to cherish the friendships that are forged in Northland. Our representatives from each stream recollected how experiences in school have shaped them to become the person that they are. Finally, our students marked the last day of their secondary school life by singing their school song, &ldquo;Responsible and Resolute&rdquo; for the last time.</p>
