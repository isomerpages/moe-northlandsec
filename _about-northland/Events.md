<h4><strong>Learners who Share &ndash; An outing to watch Meenah and Cheenah</strong></h4>
<p>On 13 May, our teachers brought the Upper Secondary Literature students to Capitol Theatre to watch Meenah and Cheenah, a play staged by Dream Academy. The students were extremely excited as the play was a sweet celebration of the end of the exam season!</p>
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTl35EHjjIiRkSbNaBtxPRT3osOkkCkwa1-4ApOabEXNp98Seo8g6B6yzRJW0lcZFbdLMjQKgLyKbAG/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
<p>The play was about the close friendship of a Chinese and Malay duo, and revealed the racial harmony as well as racial stereotypes that our society perpetuates. Overall, the play was uplifting, hilarious and highly entertaining too.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what some of our students have to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I liked about the play was the inside jokes that are relatable to Singaporeans! I also liked the Tik Tok dance breaks as the actors were so cute and the audience cheered loudly for them!&rdquo; - Joy, 3A1</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rate the show 10/10. The show was very entertaining and kept me hooked from the start till the end. It really shows the stereotypes and discrimination of the minority in a controversial yet humorous way. I also enjoyed spending time with my peers. Definitely a highlight of my secondary 4 year!&ldquo; - Hari, 4R4</p>
<p>Indeed, teachers and students alike were laughing throughout the play! We are already looking forward to the next opportunity to bring the students out for a play.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Council Investiture 2020</strong></h4>
<p>This year marks the inaugural Student Council Investiture. The ceremony albeit done in a smaller scale, was still much celebrated with dignity and meaning. Our first elected President of Student Council, Sheila Ng Xin Yi (3A2), led all the newly-appointed Executive Committee Members in the oath-taking. They pledged their unwavering commitment to be the voice of Northstars and to serve the school with confidence and pride. While the incoming leaders were invested, the outgoing leaders were honoured for their service and dedication. The legacy left behind by their predecessors will continue to be strengthened by the new generation of leaders. The shift from Prefectorial to Student Council Board has been a testament of such spirit, which runs analogous to this year&rsquo;s theme of, &lsquo;Empowered to Excel&rsquo;.</p>

<h4><strong>Northland Commemorates Racial Harmony Day</strong></h4>
<p>Racial Harmony Day was commemorated in a very different way this year. We could not celebrate as a whole community as we normally do, and so the school worked really hard to make sure that whatever we did do was as meaningful as possible. We would like to thank the teachers who have offered to star in our special Racial Harmony video. This has generated deep reflections and sharing, highlighting student voice through the reflections, demonstrating the power of personal stories. Our festivities along the corridor and the special dishes in the canteen were the amazing icing on the cake, wrapping up a week of deep reflection with a lighter touch to awareness building through food.</p>

<h4><strong>Movie Night</strong></h4>
<p>On 26 July Friday, 98 students and their families had a blast watching the movie, &ldquo;Aquaman&rdquo; in our school hall. There was a kampong-like atmosphere with everyone relaxing as they watched the movie &ldquo;Aquaman&rdquo;. This activity was organised by our dedicated Parent Support Group (PSG). Our students went home with wonderful memories.</p>

<h4><strong>Racial Harmony Week</strong></h4>
<p>Between 15 and 19 July 2019, Northland Secondary School celebrated Racial Harmony Week. A series of meaningful activities were lined up, including classroom discussions on racial harmony in Singapore, a special&nbsp;<strong>Citizenship Ceremony</strong>&nbsp;for where our Secondary 3s reflected on their responsibilities as Citizens in our multiracial context, a session of&nbsp;<strong>Cultural Bites</strong>&nbsp;where students, staff and partners got to sample Kacang Puteh, and a hall concert focused on our cultural diversity. We are also very heartened to have our&nbsp;<strong>PSG members</strong>&nbsp;come on board our RHD celebrations, with them organising a display of carefully curated ethnic items at Makers to help our students learn about our multiculturalism.</p>
