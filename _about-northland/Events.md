<h4><strong>Learners who Share &ndash; An outing to watch Meenah and Cheenah</strong></h4>
<p>On 13 May, our teachers brought the Upper Secondary Literature students to Capitol Theatre to watch Meenah and Cheenah, a play staged by Dream Academy. The students were extremely excited as the play was a sweet celebration of the end of the exam season!</p>
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTl35EHjjIiRkSbNaBtxPRT3osOkkCkwa1-4ApOabEXNp98Seo8g6B6yzRJW0lcZFbdLMjQKgLyKbAG/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
<p>The play was about the close friendship of a Chinese and Malay duo, and revealed the racial harmony as well as racial stereotypes that our society perpetuates. Overall, the play was uplifting, hilarious and highly entertaining too.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what some of our students have to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I liked about the play was the inside jokes that are relatable to Singaporeans! I also liked the Tik Tok dance breaks as the actors were so cute and the audience cheered loudly for them!&rdquo; - Joy, 3A1</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rate the show 10/10. The show was very entertaining and kept me hooked from the start till the end. It really shows the stereotypes and discrimination of the minority in a controversial yet humorous way. I also enjoyed spending time with my peers. Definitely a highlight of my secondary 4 year!&ldquo; - Hari, 4R4</p>
<p>Indeed, teachers and students alike were laughing throughout the play! We are already looking forward to the next opportunity to bring the students out for a play.</p>
