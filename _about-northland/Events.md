<h4><strong>Learners who Share &ndash; An outing to watch Meenah and Cheenah</strong></h4>
<p>On 13 May, our teachers brought the Upper Secondary Literature students to Capitol Theatre to watch Meenah and Cheenah, a play staged by Dream Academy. The students were extremely excited as the play was a sweet celebration of the end of the exam season!</p>
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTl35EHjjIiRkSbNaBtxPRT3osOkkCkwa1-4ApOabEXNp98Seo8g6B6yzRJW0lcZFbdLMjQKgLyKbAG/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
<p>The play was about the close friendship of a Chinese and Malay duo, and revealed the racial harmony as well as racial stereotypes that our society perpetuates. Overall, the play was uplifting, hilarious and highly entertaining too.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what some of our students have to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I liked about the play was the inside jokes that are relatable to Singaporeans! I also liked the Tik Tok dance breaks as the actors were so cute and the audience cheered loudly for them!&rdquo; - Joy, 3A1</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rate the show 10/10. The show was very entertaining and kept me hooked from the start till the end. It really shows the stereotypes and discrimination of the minority in a controversial yet humorous way. I also enjoyed spending time with my peers. Definitely a highlight of my secondary 4 year!&ldquo; - Hari, 4R4</p>
<p>Indeed, teachers and students alike were laughing throughout the play! We are already looking forward to the next opportunity to bring the students out for a play.</p>

They were also addressed virtually by our Grassroots Advisor, Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang, who wished us well and also exhorted us to be green advocates. Over the next few days, our students went through adapted experiences based on the level themes &ndash; Living in Harmony with Nature, Towards a Zero Waste Nation, Promoting Eco-Smart Towns. Our Artmosphere exhibition featured &ldquo;Breathe!&rdquo;, an art installation which serves as a reminder to recycle and be kind to Mother Earth.</p>

<h4><strong>Northland Celebrates Hari Raya</strong></h4>
<p>Northland held our Hari Raya celebrations on the last day of school, 28 May.&nbsp;This year's celebration is aptly themed&nbsp;<strong><em>Adaptability in Adversity</em></strong>&nbsp;where we stay resilient and united in preserving our cultural practices despite facing difficulties. We started our unique online celebrations with our Principal wishing all Muslim colleagues and Northstars a safe and peaceful Hari Raya in her Closing of Term address. Then we showcased how a school staff celebrated Hari Raya differently, before we were entertained by our Malay Dancers and educated by our talented Northstars in a heartwarming skit. We ended the celebrations with a design-your-own Malay costume competition.</p>

<h4><strong>Northland Secondary School Speech &amp; Prize-Giving Day 2021 &ndash; Revitalise!</strong></h4>
<p>Our school celebrated the achievements of our students on 23 April 2021. This year, our theme is &lsquo;Revitalise!&rsquo;. &ldquo;Revitalise!&rdquo; is a deliberate &lsquo;pause&rsquo; in our journey of integrating students, staff and systems, to allow us to crystallise the school&rsquo;s strategic direction and work towards our vision. The intent of this reflective stock-take is to invigorate our students and staff to scale greater heights and taste greater successes in the journey ahead. Our day began with a fringe activity followed by our Northstars&rsquo; well wishes to their schoolmates. We had our Prize-Giving Day later in the morning with our Polaris Award going to Clarice Ong of 4R2, class of 2020, who encouraged our Northstars not to procrastinate and to reach for the stars. Our Speech Day ended with the whole school singing our school song, promising to go &ldquo;From Triumph to Triumph&rdquo;!</p>
