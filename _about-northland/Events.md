Our students took a trip down memory lane and witnessed how they have grown from boys to men and for the ladies; from girls to young ladies. Our School Leaders and Year Head also congratulated our graduates and exhorted them to continue learning and to cherish the friendships that are forged in Northland. Our representatives from each stream recollected how experiences in school have shaped them to become the person that they are. Finally, our students marked the last day of their secondary school life by singing their school song, &ldquo;Responsible and Resolute&rdquo; for the last time.</p>

<h4><strong>Northland Commemorates Racial Harmony Day &ndash; Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic</strong></h4>
<p>Northland Secondary School commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 22 July. The day serves to remind us to be proud of our heritage and to learn to live in harmony and celebrate our unique, cross-cultural nature. Our Northstars came to school, dressed in their ethnic clothes to mark this important day. They were also treated to cultural delicacies during their breaks. The highlight of the day is definitely the assembly programme which served to educate and entertain our Northstars on racial harmony.</p>
