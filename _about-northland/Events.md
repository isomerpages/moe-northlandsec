<p>“Always study at your own pace. It is good to have stress but make sure
those are beneficial stress that can help you grow.” These were the wise
words from Jack Tay from 4 Vega when asked about his secret for success.</p>
<p>On Monday, 18 December 2023, graduating students from Northland Secondary
School received their GCE N-level results. All of them were warmly welcomed
by our School Leaders and Year Head.</p>
<p>Our top performers paid tribute to their teachers, parents and peers for
their tremendous support. Rony Liao (4 Rigel) dedicated his results to
his late grandfather for motivating him to reach for the stars. Cathrina
Ng (4 Rigel) paid tribute to her Class Mentor, Mr Ou Jian Wen for helping
her to improve. For Poojasri (4 Rigel), her family was there to share her
joy with her. Jack was grateful to Mr Ernest Yeo, his Class Mentor, Mr
Razak and Mdm Hor Kar Wai for being there for him, encouraging him when
the going got tough.</p>
<p>So what’s next for our Northstars? Lezanne Gan (4 Vega) has set her sights
to realising her dreams of being a chef, while Jack wants to pursue a course
on Pastry and Baking. Cathrina and Rony hope to get into the Polytechnic
Foundation Programme (PFP).</p>
<p>The students were asked what advice they would like to share with their
juniors. Lezanne reminds her juniors to never give up and always be confident
of themselves. Cathrina shares that it is never too late to work hard and
Rony reiterates that time is a thief and we must work hard so that we will
not regret our actions. Wise words from our top performers indeed.</p>
<p>Once again, congratulations Northstars for your stellar performances!</p>

</div>
<p>A big round of applause for Guo Zheng on his very first foray into the
National Singapore Wushu Championships 2023 amidst 24 other competitors
during the 22nd Nov - Wednesday's event for First International Spear (Boys)
Youth.</p>
<p>He did well for his first foray in the Wushu Competition and achieved
an amazing score of 7.77 for a first timer!</p>
<p>While he is only in Sec 1, age is all but a number. He has put in tremendous
effort to come this far. As A Leader Who Dares, he has never caved in to
difficulties and challenges. Instead, he takes them on bravely and conquers
every little step and obstacle along the way.</p>
<p>It is never easy but what counts most is his willingness to try and take
the first step. That is all that matters :)</p>
<p>Guo Zheng, While you do not speak up much, your actions speak volumes.
You have shown that you are a resilient athlete who stops at nothing to
achieve your best.</p>
<p>Though the competition might have caused some jitters in you, you held
your composure and kept your cool as much as you can. Mistakes are inevitable
but you persevered on despite the challenges.</p>
<p>Team Wushu is proud of you and everyone in Team Wushu because your CCA
mentors (us) have witnessed all your growth and progress in the journey
in CCA. .</p>
<p>Keep up the good work and continue to be the better versions of yourself
!</p>
<p>Given more training time and exposure, Guo Zheng will achieve what he
has set out to achieve for himself🙏🏼</p>
<p>We believe in him ! We🐝🍀 in him 🙆🏻‍♀️</p>
<h4><strong>A Leader Who Dares - Barron Lin (2 Sirius)</strong></h4>

<p>Great effort , Barron , on his very first attempt in the National Singapore
Wushu Championships 2023 amidst other competitors during 20 Nov - Monday's
event for First International Sword (Boys) Youth.</p>
<p>While he shared that he was initially scared, our assurance to him was,
"We all will be, if this is our very first time stepping onto the carpet
for national competition."</p>
<p>It is never easy but what counts most is his willingness to conquer his
fear and taking the first step. We applaud his courage.</p>
<p>Barron, Come what may. Let's face our fears. Together. You are not alone.
You have your team mates and teachers rooting for you, always.</p>
<p>Team Wushu @ Northland is very proud of everyone in Team Wushu , whether
you are taking part in this competition or being supporters for your friends
and team mates!</p>
<p>Simply because each and every one of us has a story to tell. It is not
ours to share with the rest of the world. It is not others to find out
what our story is. We all have our own story to tell. We don't need to
account for anyone but OURSELVES. We have different and unique starting
points. And it is totally okay for us to be where we are right now. It
is okay to be not okay.</p>
<p>We learn from today's lesson so that tomorrow will be an even more awesome
time for us. If we don't start now, we will never know what the future
will hold for us. As Leaders Who Dare, we make the first step to venture
into unchartered waters, knowing that every experience will be a lesson
to learn :)</p>
<p>We learn to be better versions of ourselves every time ^_^ Every day is
a new chapter 📚 Let's Seize the day! 💪🏼 Carpe Diem 🌈</p>

<p>Good Job Sarah Kaylee Cheng (2 Sirius) on her first attempt and foray
into Wushu Competition arena amidst 32 competitors during yesterday's Singapore
National Wushu Championships 2023 for First International Sword (Girls)
Youth.</p>
<p>It is never easy but what counts most is her willingness to conquer her
fear and taking the first step.All in the name of exposure. If we don't
do this now, we will never get a taste of what the future might hold. This
will be her very first official score she will have ever attained. This
will be her own benchmark to work hard and achieve her personal best every
time she sets foot on any mat. It's about competing with herself and bringing
out the better version of herself.</p>
<p>Given more training time and exposure, she will achieve what she has set
out to achieve for herself! We believe in her !</p>

<h4><strong>Leaders who Dare - Battle Royale emerges in Madagui Forest, Vietnam</strong></h4>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Amidst the Wilderness of Madagui Forest City in Vietnam, where enthusiasm
thrived amidst intense heat, 40 student leaders embarked on an exhilarating
journey to conquer the pinnacle of team-building challenges. Each student
brought a unique set of skills, an unwavering zeal for triumph, and a thirst
for victory. Divided into teams, they dove headfirst into a series of trials
meticulously designed to test their unity, problem-solving acumen, and
unyielding resilience. This transformative experience served as a catalyst
for their collective promise—a commitment to carry the invaluable lessons
learned from the Madagui Wilderness into their student leadership journey
– to be Leaders who Dare</p>
<h4><strong>Leaders who Dare - Student Leadership and Cultural Immersion Trip to Vietnam 2023</strong></h4>

</div>
<p>As part of our effort to groom our student body to be Leaders Who Dare,
we have created a top-tier leadership programme where 40 Student Councilors
and CCA leaders were selected to embark on an Overseas Leadership Trip
to Vietnam. Our student leaders were encouraged to embrace the concept
of "challenge by choice", which guided them to willingly confront their
vulnerabilities head-on, and this allowed the students to develop their
mental resilience and and leadership skills. Our leaders also developed
their civic literacy, global awareness &amp; cross-cultural skills through
various activities. These include visiting historical sites, an orphanage,
local schools, and taking part in team-building exercises in Madagui Forest
City. These experiences, tailored to cultivate daring leaders, significantly
influenced our leaders' beliefs and perspectives.</p>
<p>Ismatul Sofia from 2 Pollux shared her key takeaways about the trip: "Through
this trip, I learnt to be more grateful; for the bond with my teammates
and teachers, for the life that I have; because, life isn’t just about
being happy, the struggles that I go through in life isn’t always that
bad. I also learnt to have the courage to take a step back to observe my
surroundings, to live in the moment. Vietnam has taught me that.”</p>
<p>In essence, our goal is to inspire our students to be powerful catalysts
of change by shaping their unique journey as top leaders and leaders who
dare in NSS.</p>

<h4><strong>Northstars Shine! - Release of 2022 GCE O-level Results</strong></h4>
<p>On Monday 12 January, graduating students from Northland Secondary School
received their GCE O-level results. All of them were warmly received by
our School Leaders and Year Head. After a short JAE briefing, the graduating
students received their result slips from their respective Class Mentors.</p>
<p>Our top students paid tribute to their family, friends and teachers for
being with them in this journey. Lyu Jiayin (4R1) is thankful for her parents’
faith in her and Anna Aaditya (4R1) is grateful for an inspirational Class
Mentor in Mr Chen Weizhong. Lyu Shuchang (4R1) is appreciative of the valuable
lessons imparted to her by her teachers, not just subject content, but
also lifelong values such as responsibility and resilience.</p>
<p>Lok Yong Ching (4R3, Nicole Low (4R1), Aadi, Jiayin and Shuchang have
all set their sights to going to the junior college of their choice to
complete their A levels. Our top scorers would also like to share some
tips with their juniors about preparing for examinations. Shuchang philosophises,
“Our boat would inevitably face the danger of capsizing while sailing in
the interminable sea of life challenges. We should not avoid boarding the
boat because of fear, but to learn to sail with better skills so as to
not let the waves devour us. Most importantly, you must always have belief
in yourself.” Nicole advises, “Work hard , play hard. Truly immerse yourself
in the activities that are provided by the school. While enjoying and having
fun, don’t forget to focus and put in effort in your studies. Plan your
time well and do the right thing at the right time!”&nbsp;</p>

their tremendous support. Shawn Yo (4R4) dedicated his success to his mother

him to improve his English Language. Aiw Rui En (4R6) is grateful for having
a great friend in May Thu Nyunt (4R6) who supported her through arduous
times. Rishikka (4R8) is also grateful to her parents as well as teachers
like Ms Haw Yubin, Ms Nora and Mr Aaron Rajoo for helping her to realise
her potential.</p>
<p>So what’s next for our Northstars? Shawn has set his sights on the Polytechnic
Foundation Programme (PFP). May wants to continue to Secondary 5 to complete
her Secondary Education and Rishikka wants to fulfil her lifelong dream
of being a nurse.</p>
<p>The students were asked what advice they would like to share with their
juniors. Sneha (4R5) reminds her juniors to not underestimate themselves
and with enough effort, they can achieve their dreams. Rui En reminds our
Northstars that the national examinations is just a journey and if they
have done their best, there is nothing to worry about. Rishikka also reiterates
the importance of being focused in class. Jane exhorts her juniors to never
ever give up and Shawn echoes, “Work hard and don’t give up as hard work
truly pays off!” Wise words from our top performers indeed.</p>

<p>23 September 2022 marked the end of the secondary school life for the
class of 2022. Our students took a trip down memory lane and witnessed
how they have grown from boys to men and for the ladies; from girls to
young ladies. Our School Leaders and Year Head also congratulated our graduates
and exhorted them to continue learning and to cherish the friendships that
are forged in Northland. Our representatives from each stream recollected
how experiences in school have shaped them to become the person that they
are. Finally, our students marked the last day of their secondary school
life by singing their school song, “Responsible and Resolute” for the last
time.</p>

<h4><strong>Learners who Share – An outing to watch Meenah and Cheenah</strong></h4>
<p>On 13 May, our teachers brought the Upper Secondary Literature students
to Capitol Theatre to watch Meenah and Cheenah, a play staged by Dream
Academy. The students were extremely excited as the play was a sweet celebration
of the end of the exam season!</p>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">

</div>
<p>The play was about the close friendship of a Chinese and Malay duo, and
revealed the racial harmony as well as racial stereotypes that our society
perpetuates. Overall, the play was uplifting, hilarious and highly entertaining
too.</p>
<p>Here’s what some of our students have to say:</p>
<p>“What I liked about the play was the inside jokes that are relatable to
Singaporeans! I also liked the Tik Tok dance breaks as the actors were
so cute and the audience cheered loudly for them!” - Joy, 3A1</p>
<p>“I rate the show 10/10. The show was very entertaining and kept me hooked
from the start till the end. It really shows the stereotypes and discrimination
of the minority in a controversial yet humorous way. I also enjoyed spending
time with my peers. Definitely a highlight of my secondary 4 year!“ - Hari,
4R4</p>
<p>Indeed, teachers and students alike were laughing throughout the play!
We are already looking forward to the next opportunity to bring the students
out for a play.</p>

<h4><strong>SPARCLE 2 - Green Earth for Everyone</strong></h4>
<p>This year, we show our resilience and ability to adapt by organising SPARCLE
2 in a brand new manner. Northstars were able to witness the opening ceremony
either from home or from their classrooms. They were also addressed virtually
by our Grassroots Advisor, Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang, who wished us well and
also exhorted us to be green advocates. Over the next few days, our students
went through adapted experiences based on the level themes – Living in
Harmony with Nature, Towards a Zero Waste Nation, Promoting Eco-Smart Towns.
Our Artmosphere exhibition featured “Breathe!”, an art installation which
serves as a reminder to recycle and be kind to Mother Earth.</p>

<h4><strong>Northland Celebrates Hari Raya</strong></h4>
<p>Northland held our Hari Raya celebrations on the last day of school, 28
May.&nbsp;This year's celebration is aptly themed&nbsp;<strong><em>Adaptability in Adversity</em></strong>&nbsp;where
we stay resilient and united in preserving our cultural practices despite
facing difficulties. We started our unique online celebrations with our
Principal wishing all Muslim colleagues and Northstars a safe and peaceful
Hari Raya in her Closing of Term address. Then we showcased how a school
staff celebrated Hari Raya differently, before we were entertained by our
Malay Dancers and educated by our talented Northstars in a heartwarming
skit. We ended the celebrations with a design-your-own Malay costume competition.</p>

<h4><strong>Northland Secondary School Speech &amp; Prize-Giving Day 2021 – Revitalise!</strong></h4>
<p>Our school celebrated the achievements of our students on 23 April 2021.
This year, our theme is ‘Revitalise!’. “Revitalise!” is a deliberate ‘pause’
in our journey of integrating students, staff and systems, to allow us
to crystallise the school’s strategic direction and work towards our vision.
The intent of this reflective stock-take is to invigorate our students
and staff to scale greater heights and taste greater successes in the journey
ahead. Our day began with a fringe activity followed by our Northstars’
well wishes to their schoolmates. We had our Prize-Giving Day later in
the morning with our Polaris Award going to Clarice Ong of 4R2, class of
2020, who encouraged our Northstars not to procrastinate and to reach for
the stars. Our Speech Day ended with the whole school singing our school
song, promising to go “From Triumph to Triumph”!</p>

The event kicked off with a nostalgic video clip taking the students down
memory lane. Mdm Tan also congratulated the students and reminded them
on the importance of diligence and cultivating a sense of gratitude. This
was followed by the speeches by the representatives of each stream and
a video of well wishes from the Form Teachers of the graduating classes.

<h4><strong>Teachers’ Day Celebrations</strong></h4>
<p>This year’s Teachers’ Day Celebrations took a different form but it was
still nonetheless a significant one. The theme for this year’s Teachers’
Day Celebrations was entitled “Those were the Days”. Our day started with
our Northstars preparing handmade bouquets to be presented to their Form
Teachers. This was soon followed by a fun teacher-and-students bonding
session through a game of Jeopardy. Our online concert soon started with
our teachers reminiscing about their past and the school was also treated
to enchanting performances by the MCAC and our ACE students. Our highlight,
the GEMS Awards paid tribute to our teachers who have gone the extra mile
to nurture character and inspire learning. After the concert, the teachers

<h4><strong>Student Council Investiture 2020</strong></h4>
<p>This year marks the inaugural Student Council Investiture. The ceremony
albeit done in a smaller scale, was still much celebrated with dignity
and meaning. Our first elected President of Student Council, Sheila Ng
Xin Yi (3A2), led all the newly-appointed Executive Committee Members in
the oath-taking. They pledged their unwavering commitment to be the voice
of Northstars and to serve the school with confidence and pride. While
the incoming leaders were invested, the outgoing leaders were honoured
for their service and dedication. The legacy left behind by their predecessors
will continue to be strengthened by the new generation of leaders. The
shift from Prefectorial to Student Council Board has been a testament of
such spirit, which runs analogous to this year’s theme of, ‘Empowered to
Excel’.</p>

<h4><strong>Northland Commemorates Racial Harmony Day</strong></h4>
<p>Racial Harmony Day was commemorated in a very different way this year.
We could not celebrate as a whole community as we normally do, and so the
school worked really hard to make sure that whatever we did do was as meaningful
as possible. We would like to thank the teachers who have offered to star
in our special Racial Harmony video. This has generated deep reflections
and sharing, highlighting student voice through the reflections, demonstrating
the power of personal stories. Our festivities along the corridor and the
special dishes in the canteen were the amazing icing on the cake, wrapping
up a week of deep reflection with a lighter touch to awareness building
through food.</p>

<h4><strong>Teachers’ Day Celebrations</strong></h4>
<p>Northland celebrated Teachers’ Day on 5 September with a series of activities
to revel the day for our committed educators. Students designed personalised
dedications on clipboards for their teachers to show their appreciation.

<h4><strong>Northland Celebrates Singapore's 54th National Day</strong></h4>
<p>On 8 August 2018, our school celebrated Singapore’s 54th National Day.
We started the morning with the Parade Observance Ceremony. Our school’s
uniformed groups have put in a lot of time and effort to organise the parade,
which lent the celebrations ceremonial splendour, and gave it significance.
The parade really showed the resilience of our Northstars. After the parade,
the students proceeded back to class for the Bicentennial Clay-Making activity
as well as dressing up their runway icon. The students had a lot of fun
bonding with one another. That was followed by an entertaining performance
by our Northstars and a showcase of the SG icons. The celebrations ended
on a high with community singing and the recitation of the National Pledge
with gusto.</p>
