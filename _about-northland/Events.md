<h4><strong>Northstars Shine! - Release of 2022 GCE O-level Results</strong></h4>
<p>On Monday 12 January, graduating students from Northland Secondary School received their GCE O-level results. All of them were warmly received by our School Leaders and Year Head. After a short JAE briefing, the graduating students received their result slips from their respective Class Mentors.</p>
<p>Our top students paid tribute to their family, friends and teachers for being with them in this journey. Lyu Jiayin (4R1) is thankful for her parents’ faith in her and Anna Aaditya (4R1) is grateful for an inspirational Class Mentor in Mr Chen Weizhong. Lyu Shuchang (4R1) is appreciative of the valuable lessons imparted to her by her teachers, not just subject content, but also lifelong values such as responsibility and resilience.</p>
<p>Lok Yong Ching (4R3, Nicole Low (4R1), Aadi, Jiayin and Shuchang have all set their sights to going to the junior college of their choice to complete their A levels. Our top scorers would also like to share some tips with their juniors about preparing for examinations. Shuchang philosophises, “Our boat would inevitably face the danger of capsizing while sailing in the interminable sea of life challenges. We should not avoid boarding the boat because of fear, but to learn to sail with better skills so as to not let the waves devour us. Most importantly, you must always have belief in yourself.” Nicole advises, “Work hard , play hard. Truly immerse yourself in the activities that are provided by the school. While enjoying and having fun, don’t forget to focus and put in effort in your studies. Plan your time well and do the right thing at the right time!”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, congratulations Northstars for your stellar performances!</p>

<h4><strong>Learners who Share – An outing to watch Meenah and Cheenah</strong></h4>
<p>On 13 May, our teachers brought the Upper Secondary Literature students to Capitol Theatre to watch Meenah and Cheenah, a play staged by Dream Academy. The students were extremely excited as the play was a sweet celebration of the end of the exam season!</p>
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTl35EHjjIiRkSbNaBtxPRT3osOkkCkwa1-4ApOabEXNp98Seo8g6B6yzRJW0lcZFbdLMjQKgLyKbAG/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=10000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Here’s what some of our students have to say:</p>
<p>“What I liked about the play was the inside jokes that are relatable to Singaporeans! I also liked the Tik Tok dance breaks as the actors were so cute and the audience cheered loudly for them!” - Joy, 3A1</p>
<p>“I rate the show 10/10. The show was very entertaining and kept me hooked from the start till the end. It really shows the stereotypes and discrimination of the minority in a controversial yet humorous way. I also enjoyed spending time with my peers. Definitely a highlight of my secondary 4 year!“ - Hari, 4R4</p>
<p>Indeed, teachers and students alike were laughing throughout the play! We are already looking forward to the next opportunity to bring the students out for a play.</p>

<p>25 September 2020 marked the end of the secondary school education for the class of 2020. The momentous day was carried out remotely in our classes. The event kicked off with a nostalgic video clip taking the students down memory lane. Mdm Tan also congratulated the students and reminded them on the importance of diligence and cultivating a sense of gratitude. This was followed by the speeches by the representatives of each stream and a video of well wishes from the Form Teachers of the graduating classes. It was a day of pride and joy as students marked the last day of their secondary school life by singing “Responsible and Resolute” for the last time.</p>

<h4><strong>Teachers’ Day Celebrations</strong></h4>
<p>This year’s Teachers’ Day Celebrations took a different form but it was still nonetheless a significant one. The theme for this year’s Teachers’ Day Celebrations was entitled “Those were the Days”. Our day started with our Northstars preparing handmade bouquets to be presented to their Form Teachers. This was soon followed by a fun teacher-and-students bonding session through a game of Jeopardy. Our online concert soon started with our teachers reminiscing about their past and the school was also treated to enchanting performances by the MCAC and our ACE students. Our highlight, the GEMS Awards paid tribute to our teachers who have gone the extra mile to nurture character and inspire learning. After the concert, the teachers attended an online Zoom lunch to end the celebrations.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Council Investiture 2020</strong></h4>
<p>This year marks the inaugural Student Council Investiture. The ceremony albeit done in a smaller scale, was still much celebrated with dignity and meaning. Our first elected President of Student Council, Sheila Ng Xin Yi (3A2), led all the newly-appointed Executive Committee Members in the oath-taking. They pledged their unwavering commitment to be the voice of Northstars and to serve the school with confidence and pride. While the incoming leaders were invested, the outgoing leaders were honoured for their service and dedication. The legacy left behind by their predecessors will continue to be strengthened by the new generation of leaders. The shift from Prefectorial to Student Council Board has been a testament of such spirit, which runs analogous to this year’s theme of, ‘Empowered to Excel’.</p>

<h4><strong>Northland Commemorates Racial Harmony Day</strong></h4>
<p>Racial Harmony Day was commemorated in a very different way this year. We could not celebrate as a whole community as we normally do, and so the school worked really hard to make sure that whatever we did do was as meaningful as possible. We would like to thank the teachers who have offered to star in our special Racial Harmony video. This has generated deep reflections and sharing, highlighting student voice through the reflections, demonstrating the power of personal stories. Our festivities along the corridor and the special dishes in the canteen were the amazing icing on the cake, wrapping up a week of deep reflection with a lighter touch to awareness building through food.</p>

<h4><strong>Northland celebrates Hari Raya Aidilfitri</strong></h4>
<p>Northland celebrated Hari Raya Aidilfitri on the last day of school, 31 June. The Malay Unit put up a musical skit which emphasised the importance of preserving our tradition, just like the popular Malay proverb, ‘Hidup dikandung adat, mati dikandung tanah’. The skit weaved in entertaining performances such as Dikir Barat as well as an amazing performance by our Malay Dancers.

<h4><strong>Education Minister Mr Ong Ye Kung visits Northland Secondary School</strong></h4>
<p>Education Minister Mr Ong Ye Kung visits Northland Secondary School On 16 October 2018, our school welcomed the presence of a very important guest - our very own Education Minister, Mr Ong Ye Kung. Mr Ong enjoyed a lunch dialogue with our Northstars and encouraged them to focus on learning and doing their best. Mr Ong also had a dialogue with our teachers and wanted to know more about their views of the recent Workplan Seminar announcements on reducing assessment load and shared his perspectives on focusing on better teaching and better learning. It was definitely an enriching experience for both Northstars and staff.</p>
