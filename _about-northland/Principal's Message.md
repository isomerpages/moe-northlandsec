## Celebrating Our Journey: 30 Years of Excellence

As we step into 2025, I reflect with immense pride on our journey together. Having celebrated our 30th anniversary in 2024, Northland Secondary has firmly established itself as an institution that provides a strong foundation in character development and academic resilience for our Northstars before they transit to their chosen post-secondary paths.

#### Creating a Second Home
At Northland, we recognise that our Northstars spend over six hours daily within these walls—a significant portion of their formative adolescent years. The quality of education and environment we provide leaves a lasting impact on their development. This is why we remain steadfast in our commitment to being an **inviting school** that offers positive, meaningful experiences for every Northstar.

Our vision is simple yet profound: to create a second home where Northstars feel a sense of belonging, pride, and joy. A place where they can grow, learn, and discover themselves in a safe, nurturing environment.

#### The Heart of Northland: Our Starmakers

Northland is blessed with an exceptional team of dedicated, competent, and nurturing teachers and support staff—our Starmakers. These individuals pour their hearts into creating a vibrant learning community where every Northstar can flourish.

Our Starmakers don't just teach; they inspire. They don't just support; they nurture. They are the pillars that make Northland a home away from home—for both themselves and our students.

We are committed to fostering a workplace culture where our staff are professionally supported and encouraged to prioritise their well-being and self-care, knowing that when our Starmakers shine, our Northstars soar higher.

#### Our Approach: Firm Yet Caring

As we journey through 2025, my staff and I commit to being firm yet caring, demanding yet nurturing. We understand that growth requires both challenge and support—and we strive to provide the perfect balance of both. Our goal is to make every day at Northland positive and fulfilling, creating an environment conducive to learning, growth, and meaningful connections.

#### Looking Forward: Exciting Developments for 2025

Beyond our signature programs, 2025 brings several exciting developments:

*   **External Engagement**: We will host personnel from the Centre for School Excellence, MOE with school leaders from other schools to engage in meaningful conversations about our policies, processes, and structures that make Northland an inviting school.
*   **Global Exposure**: Our Northstars will embark on cultural immersion and overseas learning journeys to Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Indonesia, broadening their worldview and deepening their cultural understanding.
*   **Expanded Opportunities**: Lower secondary Northstars will enjoy more CCA choices with the expansion to include several CCAs within the N2 cluster of schools. Our collaboration with SJI enters its second year, featuring combined hockey training for the Boys C division.
*   **Enhanced Facilities**: Newly renovated learning spaces include pockets of learning corners within the school canteen, a multi-usage space transformed from the former AV theaterette, and improved ventilation in the ISH with the installation of high-volume low-speed fans.

#### Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) Journey
We proudly welcome our third batch of Secondary 1 FSBB students in 2025. Our pioneering FSBB cohorts have thrived in their diverse form classes, and we look forward to our first batch of FSBB Northstars sitting for their national examinations in 2027.

#### SHINE: Our Guiding Light
In 2024, as part of our 30th anniversary celebrations, we introduced our school motto: SHINE. At Northland, we don't just educate or learn—we SHINE:

*   **S**tarmakers: Our incredible teachers and staff, lighting the path for our Northstars.
*   **H**eartfelt connections: Northland is where dreams take flight and lifelong friendships bloom.
*   **I**ndomitable spirit: Resilience personified in both our Starmakers and Northstars.
*   **N**orthstars: Our amazing students discovering passions and conquering challenges with responsibility.
*   **E**ndless possibilities: Stepping into the future with hope and determination.

#### Our Commitment

My staff and I are deeply committed to unleashing the potential in each and every Northstar, staying true to our mission to Inspire Learners and Nurture Character. Let us come together as one Northland family to become the best versions of ourselves—Learners who Share, Citizens who Care, and Leaders who Dare.

So, Northstars and Starmakers, let's keep that sparkle in our eyes and that spring in our step. Together, we're not just reaching for the stars—we're becoming them. Every day is a chance to shine a little brighter at Northland Secondary!

Warm regards,

Lim Kok Hwa

Principal, Northland Secondary School
