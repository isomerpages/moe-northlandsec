<p>On Thursday, 4 September, our Northstars came together to give thanks
to our amazing Starmakers with a day full of joy and appreciation! The
festivities kicked off with a fun bonding session between Northstars and
their Class Mentors. Soon after, the whole school gathered in the hall
for a vibrant concert, where students lit up the stage with their talents
to thank their teachers. A special highlight was the GEMS awards, shining
the spotlight on our Caring Starmakers.Northland celebrates Starmakers'
