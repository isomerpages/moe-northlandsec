On Sunday 30 July, Northstars from 2 Pollux set up a booth at Nee Soon East Senior Hub to interact with the residents in the community and to share about the schoolsâ€™ efforts in the area of recycling, composting and edible landscaping. There was a huge turn-out and it provided an invaluable opportunity for our students to build confidence in the area of public speaking as they went about sharing their green experiences with the residents who visited the booth. As a result, a number of residents went on and pledge and to do their part for the environment. Well done Northstars!
