On 15 to 18 May, our Secondary 1 Northstars took part in the Applied Learning Programmne (ALP) Code for Fun. The students had a good time with the coding sessions as well as assembling a truck using cardboards. They had opportunity to troubleshoot their codes so that their prototypes can function as intended.
