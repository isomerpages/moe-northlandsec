<p>On Friday, 8 August 2025, Northland Secondary School came alive with the
vibrant sights and sounds of a joyful celebration marking Singapore’s 60th
birthday.</p>
<p>In line with our SG60 theme of “Building Our Singapore Together”, we hosted
the NSS SG60 National Day Carnival, which brought together students, staff,
and the community in a spirit of unity and pride. The carnival featured
a wide variety of booths – from games and photo stations to art, craft,
and mental wellness activities. In the weeks leading to the celebration,
students and staff worked tirelessly to prepare for the event. Coupon sales
generated enthusiastic participation, with everyone contributing to make
the day meaningful and memorable. Proceeds from the carnival were donated
to Montfort Care – GoodLife! Yishun, an elderly care centre that provides
a safe, caring, and vibrant environment for seniors in our community.</p>
<p>Celebrations also took place in the classrooms, where students participated
in a National Day Lesson on Project Citizen – The First Million. They listened
to inspiring stories of Singapore’s nation-building journey from the pioneer
generation, sparking reflection on how the present and future generations
can play an active role in shaping our nation’s future. This was followed
by National Day games, filling the classrooms with laughter, friendly competition,
and class bonding.</p>
