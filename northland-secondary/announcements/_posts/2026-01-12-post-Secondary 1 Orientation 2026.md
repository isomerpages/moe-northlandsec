<p>Northland welcomes our new Northstars who have joined our school! To facilitate
a smooth transition to secondary school, we have organised a series of
activities aimed at helping our new students become familiar with the school
environment. The orientation also included a school tour, meet-and-greet
sessions with Class Mentors, and CCA orientation. It culminated with the
Parents’ Session, where parents had the opportunity to see their children
in their new school.</p>
