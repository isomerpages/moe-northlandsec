The X-Cite Games is part of the school’s Learning for Life Programme, "Game for Life" which leverages sports and physical activity to prepare our Northstars for life by imbuing them with strong social-emotional competencies grounded on our core values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience. In the X-Cite Games series, classes got to pit their skills against one another in a variety of games like soccer, Captain’s ball, ultimate frisbee and handball.
