<p>Northland commemorated Total Defence Day with a suite of experiential
learning activities to drive home the message - “Together, We Keep Singapore
Strong”. Our Secondary 1s learnt how to perform CPR and our Secondary 2s
went on learning journeys to learn more about the importance of military
defence. Our Secondary 3s learnt more about Changi Airport in the Changi
Experience Studio and our graduating classes attended a VIA Fair. The whole
school also participated in a Fire Drill to learn about emergency preparedness
and experienced a food disruption exercise.</p>
