‘A Rojak Raya’ is the theme for this year’s Hari Raya celebrations. Rojak is a dish that boasts multi-ethnic diversity and myriad variations in taste and ingredients. Similarly, the concert aims to remind Starmakers and Northstars that Hari Raya is celebrated by Muslims in Singapore and all around the world, regardless their ethnicities. The celebration featured elements of educating through games, fashion influences and food, all of which was conceptualised, assembled and executed by student directors.
