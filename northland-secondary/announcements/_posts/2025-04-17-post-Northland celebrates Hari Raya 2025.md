<p>Northland celebrated Hari Raya on Friday, 4 April, showcasing an enchanting
celebration of cultural richness and artistic flair. Our talented Northstars
and Starmakers lit up the stage with their captivating voices and outstanding
performances. The concert began with a vibrant Kompang performance by our
Northland girls, setting a lively tone for the event. This was followed
by a soulful Dikir Barat performance by our boys, impressing the audience
with their rhythm and unity. Our Northstars gained a deeper understanding
of the significance of Hari Raya through the series of performances prepared
for them.</p>
