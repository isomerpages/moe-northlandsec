<p>Northland celebrated Youth Day on Friday July 11th, with a memorable and
enjoyable experience for all students. The day was filled with fun activities,
including dressing up as their future selves, sharing popsicles with friends,
capturing memories at the photo booth, and being entertained by a lively
concert performed by our talented Northstars and Starmakers. Our School
Leaders also embraced their playful side, showcasing their dance moves
and engaging with the younger students in a fun and energetic manner.</p>
