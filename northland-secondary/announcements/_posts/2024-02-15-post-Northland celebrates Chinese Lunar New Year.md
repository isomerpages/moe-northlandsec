<p>Northland ushered in the Chinese Lunar New Year on 9 February. This year,
the theme for the New Year celebrations is ‘Soaring with Joy to Celebrate
The New Year’ to usher in the year of the Dragon. We were entertained by
our talented Guzheng Ensemble, Wushu and MCAC and then the highlights of
the day came - our classes’ dragon showcase, the Lion Dance display and
a visit from the ‘God of Fortune’!</p>
