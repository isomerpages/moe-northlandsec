<p>On Friday, 27 September, the class of 2024 celebrated the end of their
secondary school journey. Our Northstars reminisced about their transformation—boys
becoming young men, and girls blossoming into young ladies. The School
Leaders and Year Head extended their heartfelt congratulations, encouraging
the graduates to keep learning and cherish the friendships they built at
Northland. Best wishes to all Northstars as you embark on your future endeavours—
continue to shine!</p>
