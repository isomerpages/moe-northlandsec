<p>Northland Secondary School celebrated Pongal on Friday, 24 January with
a dance extravaganza! Pongal is a festival celebrated in South India over
four days, by farmers who give thanks to the Sun God for the blessings
of a rich harvest and our school celebrated the harvest festival with delightful
dance performances from our Northstars and Starmakers. It will be a day
to remember. #shine</p>
