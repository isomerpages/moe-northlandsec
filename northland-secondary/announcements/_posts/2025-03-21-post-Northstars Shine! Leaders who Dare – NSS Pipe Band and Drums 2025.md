<p>The NSS Pipe Band and Drums proudly participated in this year’s St. Patrick’s
Day Parade on 16 March, filling the streets with the stirring sounds of
bagpipes and drums. With the pipers dressed in their traditional kilts,
the Pipe Band Procession Group 3 (formed by NSS and Merlion) was led by
Merlion Pipe Major and NSS Leading Drummer Ooh Yu Jie (4 Castor). Marching
alongside dancers and community groups from Empress Lawn to UOB Plaza,
the bands delighted the crowd with the classic Irish and Scottish tunes,
creating an unforgettable experience for parade-goers.</p>
<p>The event was graced by Grand Marshall George Yeo and the Irish Ambassador,
who joined in the festivities, celebrating the rich heritage and community
spirit of St. Patrick’s Day. Spectators cheered as the bands from NSS,
SJI, RGS, Lion City and Merlion performed together beloved Irish and Scottish
melodies, adding an authentic and energetic atmosphere to the festivities
at the UOB Plaza. Their participation is not only a tribute to Irish heritage
but also a showcase of the dedication and talent within the piping community.</p>
