<p>Northland Secondary School celebrated Pongal on Friday, 16 January. Pongal
is a harvest festival in which farmers give thanks to the Sun God for a
bountiful harvest. Our school educates Northstars about Pongal’s significance
in our community and emphasises the importance of learning about other
cultures and traditions. This year, Nguyen Du Junior High School joined
us for the celebrations and made the celebration even more significant.</p>
