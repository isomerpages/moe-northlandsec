<p>St. Patrick's Day, a significant day which celebrates Irish culture, is
associated with the culture of playing the bagpipes and drums in Ireland
and other parts of Europe. Part of the string of events that happens during
the day of celebration would involve a parade where pipers and drummers
will perform as they march along the streets of downtown Singapore.</p>
<p>This year’s parade was held on Sunday, 17 March 2024, and the Northland
Secondary School Pipe Band and Drums CCA group had the honour of being
invited to join the celebratory event as performers for the parade contingent.
Led by our Pipe Sergeant, Cash Ng (3 Antares), and our Drum Sergeant, Ooh
Yu Jie (3 Castor), the NSS contingent put on a commendable performance
that enlivened the crowds and contributed to the festive atmosphere of
the event.</p>
<p>We were also very honoured to have been graced by the presence of Minister
for Health, Mr. Ong Ye Kung, Ireland’s Minister of State at the Department
of Health, Ms. Hildegarde Naughton, as well as Ms. Sarah McGrath, Ireland’s
Ambassador to Singapore.</p>
