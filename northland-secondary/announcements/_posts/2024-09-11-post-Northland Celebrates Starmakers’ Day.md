<p>Our Northstars paid tribute to our Starmakers on Thursday 29 August with
a series of celebratory activities. The day began with a delightful bonding
session between Northstars and their Class Mentors. Following this, the
school gathered in the hall for an entertaining concert, where students
showcased their talents as a gesture of appreciation for their teachers.
The GEMS awards were also presented, recognising our Caring Starmakers.
Our PSG members and alumni also made time from their busy schedules to
make it a truly memorable day for everyone involved.</p>
