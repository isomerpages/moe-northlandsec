<p>“Always study at your own pace. It is good to have stress but make sure
those are beneficial stress that can help you grow.” These were the wise
words from Jack Tay from 4 Vega when asked about his secret for success.</p>
<p>On Monday, 18 December 2023, graduating students from Northland Secondary
School received their GCE N-level results. All of them were warmly welcomed
by our School Leaders and Year Head.</p>
<p>Our top performers paid tribute to their teachers, parents and peers for
their tremendous support. Rony Liao (4 Rigel) dedicated his results to
his late grandfather for motivating him to reach for the stars. Cathrina
Ng (4 Rigel) paid tribute to her Class Mentor, Mr Ou Jian Wen for helping
her to improve. For Poojasri (4 Rigel), her family was there to share her
joy with her. Jack was grateful to Mr Ernest Yeo, his Class Mentor, Mr
Razak and Mdm Hor Kar Wai for being there for him, encouraging him when
the going got tough.</p>
<p>So what’s next for our Northstars? Lezanne Gan (4 Vega) has set her sights
to realising her dreams of being a chef, while Jack wants to pursue a course
on Pastry and Baking. Cathrina and Rony hope to get into the Polytechnic
Foundation Programme (PFP).</p>
<p>The students were asked what advice they would like to share with their
juniors. Lezanne reminds her juniors to never give up and always be confident
of themselves. Cathrina shares that it is never too late to work hard and
Rony reiterates that time is a thief and we must work hard so that we will
not regret our actions. Wise words from our top performers indeed.</p>
<p>Once again, congratulations Northstars for your stellar performances!</p>
