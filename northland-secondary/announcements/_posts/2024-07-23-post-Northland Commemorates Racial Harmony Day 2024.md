<p>Northland Secondary School commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 19 July.
This day serves as a reminder that everyone has a role in building a harmonious
society and that our diversity is a source of strength. Our Northstars
came to school dressed in their ethnic attire to mark this important occasion.
They enjoyed cultural delicacies during their breaks and participated actively
in their SPARCLE lesson, which focused on the importance of racial harmony
and social cohesion.</p>
