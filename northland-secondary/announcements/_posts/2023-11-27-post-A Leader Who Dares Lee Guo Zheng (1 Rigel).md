A big round of applause for Guo Zheng on his very first foray into the National Singapore Wushu Championships 2023 amidst 24 other competitors during the 22nd Nov - Wednesday's event for First International Spear (Boys) Youth.

He did well for his first foray in the Wushu Competition and achieved an amazing score of 7.77 for a first timer!

While he is only in Sec 1, age is all but a number. He has put in tremendous effort to come this far. As A Leader Who Dares, he has never caved in to difficulties and challenges. Instead, he takes them on bravely and conquers every little step and obstacle along the way.

It is never easy but what counts most is his willingness to try and take the first step. That is all that matters :)

Guo Zheng, 
While you do not speak up much, your actions speak volumes. You have shown that you are a resilient athlete who stops at nothing to achieve your best.

Though the competition might have caused some jitters in you, you held your composure and kept your cool as much as you can. Mistakes are inevitable but you persevered on despite the challenges. 

Team Wushu is proud of you and everyone in Team Wushu because your CCA mentors (us) have witnessed all your growth and progress in the journey in CCA. .

Keep up the good work and continue to be the better versions of yourself !

Given more training time and exposure, Guo Zheng will achieve what he has set out to achieve for himself🙏🏼

We believe in him !
We🐝🍀 in him 🙆🏻‍♀️
