Northland Secondary School commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 21 July. The day serves to remind us to be proud of our heritage and to learn to live in harmony and celebrate our unique, cross-cultural nature. Our Northstars came to school, dressed in their ethnic clothes to mark this important day. They were also treated to cultural delicacies during their breaks. The highlight of the day is definitely the assembly programme which served to educate and entertain our Northstars on racial harmony.
