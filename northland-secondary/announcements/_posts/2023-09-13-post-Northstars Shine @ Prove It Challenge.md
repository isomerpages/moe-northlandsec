Some of our Secondary 1 Northstars participated in the Prove It challenge organised by NLB. We sent in 2 groups which investigated the following topics:
·&nbsp;whether youth are able to identify fake news
·&nbsp;whether youth are concerned about climate

Students also had to embark on an advocacy project to help educate their schoolmates on using reliable sources. Northland is proud to announce that both groups achieved the Silver Award! The students are –

* Calvin Tan (1 Rigel),
* Viggeswarapu Mervin Axl David (1 Sirius)
* Rajesh Joan Packiajulita (1 Castor)
* Karissa Wong (1 Orion)
* S Kanchana Jai Anjana (1 Sirius)
* Ooi Jun Xiang (1 Vega)
* Rayyan Bin Riduan (1 Sirius)
* Mishel Alesha Binte Muhammad Suhaimi (1 Epsilon)
