The Northland Secondary School Pipe Band and Drums CCA group had the honour of being invited to join the St.Patrick's Day Parade as performers on Sunday, 19 March 2023.
Led by our Pipe Major, Dominic Lim (4 Orion) and our Drum Major, Grace Supasinee Wong (4 Pollux), the NSS contingent not only put on a splendid performance that enthralled the crowds, but also enlivened the atmosphere as they were the only school band that had performed a medley of pieces publicly to a live audience!
