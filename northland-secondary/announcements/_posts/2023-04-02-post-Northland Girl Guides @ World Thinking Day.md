Our Northstars, Shernyn Ng (4 Rigel), Hannah Izzah (3 Castor), Prithika (3 Sirius), Kyara (2 Orion) and Mella Melissa Kelly Topacio (2 Antares) led the North Division guides and brownies in 8 campfire songs for the North Division Day. This is their first event standing in front of a large group of audience. Even though it was not an easy feat, the girls persevered through trainings and rehearsals. They stepped out of their comfort zones to successfully lead the Sing-along segments. Well done, Guiders!![](/images/northlandgg.jpeg)
