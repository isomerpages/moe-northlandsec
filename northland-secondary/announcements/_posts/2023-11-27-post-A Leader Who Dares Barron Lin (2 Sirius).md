Great effort , Barron , on his very first attempt in the National Singapore Wushu Championships 2023 amidst other competitors during 20 Nov - Monday's event for First International Sword (Boys) Youth.

While he shared that he was initially scared, our assurance to him was, "We all will be, if this is our very first time stepping onto the carpet for national competition."

It is never easy but what counts most is his willingness to conquer his fear and taking the first step. We applaud his courage.

Barron,
Come what may.
Let's face our fears.
Together.
You are not alone.
You have your team mates and teachers rooting for you, always.

Team Wushu @ Northland is very proud of everyone in Team Wushu , whether you are taking part in this competition or being supporters for your friends and team mates!

Simply because each and every one of us has a story to tell. It is not ours to share with the rest of the world.
It is not others to find out what our story is. We all have our own story to tell. We don't need to account for anyone but OURSELVES. We have different and unique starting points. And it is totally okay for us to be where we are right now. It is okay to be not okay.

We learn from today's lesson so that tomorrow will be an even more awesome time for us. If we don't start now, we will never know what the future will hold for us. As Leaders Who Dare, we make the first step to venture into unchartered waters, knowing that every experience will be a lesson to learn :)

We learn to be better versions of ourselves every time ^_^
Every day is a new chapter 📚
Let's Seize the day! 💪🏼
Carpe Diem 🌈
