<p>Northland welcomed teachers and students from our partner school, Lutheran
Secondary School from Hong Kong on Tuesday 2 July. They visited some of
our classes and were accompanied by our Singa ambassadors. Our Performing
Arts Groups also put up memorable performances for our visitors to keep
them enchanted.</p>
