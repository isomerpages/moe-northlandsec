Owing to their hard work over the course of several weeks, the Pipe Band and Drums CCA students were able to put up outstanding performances at the Singapore Chinese Girlsâ€™ School and Yishun Secondary School where they spread the musical enchantment to much excitement and interest from the students of these schools.</p><h4></h4><p></p>
