<p>With cluster CCAs in the pipeline for schools in the N2 cluster, the Northland
Pipe Band and Drums CCA had the privilege of being invited to two cluster
schools to showcase their invigorating beats and melodies. Owing to their
hard work over the course of several weeks, the Pipe Band and Drums CCA
students were able to put up outstanding performances at the Singapore
Chinese Girlsâ€™ School and Yishun Secondary School where they spread the
musical enchantment to much excitement and interest from the students of
these schools.</p>
