Starmaker Mr Santhosh shared his T&L practice (Using Tamil song lyrics to improve situational writing skills) at the National Secondary Tamil Language professional sharing session at Chua Chu Kang Secondary School on Friday 11 August. His sharing was very well-received by the participants. Thank you, Mr Santhosh, for being a Learner who shares!
