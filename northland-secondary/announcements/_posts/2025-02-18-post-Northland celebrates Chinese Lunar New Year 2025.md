<p>Northland ushered in the Year of the Snake on 28 January. This year, the
theme for the New Year celebrations is 'Divine Snake ushers in a Joyful
New Year'. We were entertained by our talented Guzheng Ensemble, Wushu,
MCAC, our talented HOD PE CCA, a spectacular Lion Dance display and a visit
from the 'God of Fortune"!</p>
