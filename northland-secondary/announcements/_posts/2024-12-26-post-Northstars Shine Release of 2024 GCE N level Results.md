<p>“Discipline is doing what you hate to do but doing it like you love it.”
These wise words from Harvin (4 Orion) encapsulate his spirit of perseverance
and determination.</p>
<p>On Monday, 16 December 2024, graduating students from Northland Secondary
School received their GCE N-level results. They were warmly welcomed by
the Principal and AYH.</p>
<p>Our top performers expressed heartfelt gratitude to their teachers, parents,
and peers for their unwavering support. Bjorn Ong (4 Castor) thanked his
Class Mentors, Ms Mano and Mr Santhosh for their steadfast guidance and
appreciated the care shown by subject teachers like Mr Chia, Mr Ong, Mdm
Atassha, Mrs Wong, and Mdm Rozi. Xander Lim (4 Antares) paid tribute to
Mr Aaron for not only teaching him Physics but also for his consistent
check-ins on his well-being. Alita Toh (4 Orion) thanked her teachers for
believing in her and encouraging her to reach her full potential, while
Jarret Loh (4 Orion) thanked his mother for her unwavering support.</p>
<p>So, what’s next for our Northstars? Bjorn hopes to join the Polytechnic
Foundation Programme (PFP), while Xander is aiming for the Direct-Entry-Scheme
to Polytechnic Programme (DPP) in immersive applications and games.</p>
<p>When asked to share advice for their juniors, Bjorn emphasised, “Every
single second counts. As you sit at home playing a game, you could be doing
something productive and working on yourself! So don’t waste all that time
sitting at home.” Xander encouraged perseverance, saying, “Don’t give up
when the going gets tough. Keep pushing forward.” Jarret Loh offered his
nuggets for success-</p>
<p>1. Be yourself.</p>
<p>2. Believe in yourself.</p>
<p>3. Don’t be afraid to seek support.</p>
<p>4. Take small steps, no matter how big or small your goal is.</p>
<p>5. Have fun, but set boundaries for yourself.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our Northstars for your stellar performances and
for demonstrating resilience and grit!</p>
