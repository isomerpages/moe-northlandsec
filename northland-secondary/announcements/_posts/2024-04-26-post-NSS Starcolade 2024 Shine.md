<p>On Friday, April 19, our school gathered to honour the accomplishments
of our Northstars and Starmakers. With the presence of our School Advisory
Committee, the families of award recipients, and our graduating cohort,
the hall was filled with anticipation for Starcolade. The event proved
to be a resounding success, while simple, yet it was meaningful and inspiring.
Congratulations to each deserving recipient on their well-earned recognition!</p>
