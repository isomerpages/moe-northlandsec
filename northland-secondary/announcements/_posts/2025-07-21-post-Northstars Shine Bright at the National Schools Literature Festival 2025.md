<p>On 12 July 2025, our Northstars once again proved their literary prowess
and passion for the written word at the National Schools Literature Festival
(NSLF) — Singapore’s largest gathering of young literature enthusiasts.
This annual celebration of creativity, critical thinking, and performance
saw stellar participation from our students across multiple categories,
with several teams bringing home accolades that speak volumes of their
dedication and talent.</p>
<p>✨ Upper Secondary Flash Fiction (Certificate of Participation) - Syazwanie
from (3 Epsilon)</p>
<p>🥉 Lower Secondary Flash Fiction (Bronze Award) - Aisha Naoli (1 Epsilon)</p>
<p>🥉 Lower Secondary Book Trailer (Bronze Award) - Dawn, Alicia, Wint, Sophia,
and Felicia</p>
<p>🏆 Upper Secondary Unseen Text Debate (Winner) - Sofia, Kyara, Sue Ann,
Jade, and Aaliya</p>
<p>🏆 Upper Secondary Unseen Text Debate (Winner) - Syahirah, Pryonty, Sharifah,
Zizya, and Sharnita</p>
<p>Together, these achievements reflect not just the talents of individual
students, but also the guidance of dedicated teachers, the power of peer
collaboration, and a school culture that nurtures a deep love for literature.
We are incredibly proud of all our participants — their courage to compete,
the effort behind each written and spoken word, and their embodiment of
Northland’s values of Respect, Resilience, and Responsibility.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Northstars! You have truly made your mark at NSLF 2025.
Shine on! 🌟📚🎉</p>
