<p>This year’s RHD theme is “Our People, Our Tapestry” — a reminder that
Singapore’s strength lies in the beautiful threads of our different cultures,
woven together through respect, understanding, and unity. The Secondary
3 assembly talk challenged us to think deeply about issues like casual
racism and privilege. The Racial Harmony Day booth by our amazing Parent
Support Group and Singa Ambassadors, along with the Cultural Bites at the
canteen, gave students a meaningful opportunity to appreciate the rich
diversity of cultures in Singapore.</p>
