<p>What an unforgettable day! On Friday, 16 January, students, teachers,
and parents from our partner school in Hanoi visited Northland for an exciting
exchange programme. Our guests dove straight into the Northland experience
— joining lessons, joining in our vibrant Pongal celebrations, and exploring
our CCA activities. May you bring home wonderful memories of Singapore
and Northland Secondary School</p>
