Our Northstars and Starmakers went on a School Exchange and Cultural Immersion Programme in Hong Kong from 30 May to 2 June. The highlight was definitely the school visit to ELCHK Lutheran Secondary School where our Northstars went into the classes to experience school life in Hong Kong. Our Northstars make fast friends and enjoyed themselves and learned more about school life and culture in Hong Kong during the four-day trip.
