Northland celebrated Singapore’s 58th National Day with a series of activities on Tuesday 8 August. The theme for this year’s National Day is “Onward as One”, which calls upon Singaporeans to look forward confidently and move onward together in building our shared future as one united people. We had fun, wore our red and showed our pride as one nation, one Singapore!
