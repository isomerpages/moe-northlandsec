<p>On Friday, 3 October, the Class of 2025 celebrated the culmination of
their secondary school journey. Our Northstars reflected on their transformation
— boys becoming young men and girls blossoming into young ladies. The School
Leaders and Year Head offered heartfelt congratulations, encouraging the
graduates to continue learning and cherish the friendships formed at Northland
as they embark on their future endeavors — keep shining!</p>
