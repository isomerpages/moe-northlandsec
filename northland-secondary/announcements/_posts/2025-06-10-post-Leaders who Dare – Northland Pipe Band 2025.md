<p>Northland Secondary School proudly hosted the highly anticipated Singapore
Pipe Band Championships 2025 on Wednesday 4 June, bringing together talented
pipe and drum bands from across Singapore (SJI, RGS, JK, NSS, Merlion,
Lion City) for a day of music, tradition, and spirited competition.</p>
<p>The air was filled with the rich, resonant sounds of bagpipes and the
rhythmic pulse of drums as bands competed in various categories, showcasing
months of hard work and musical mastery.</p>
<p>We were honoured to welcome a distinguished panel of adjudicators from
Australia- Mr Scott Nicolson, Mr Ian Lyons and Mr Andrew Womersley. Their
keen ears and deep expertise ensured that every performance was assessed
with precision and fairness. They also took time to offer valuable feedback,
encouraging young musicians to continue refining their craft.</p>
<p>A huge thank you to all participating bands, our dedicated judges, supporters,
volunteers and the organising committee- Singapore Pipe Band Association.
Your collective efforts made the day a resounding success!</p>

and dedication! You’ve truly kept the legacy of pipe music alive — with
heart, harmony, and honor.</p>
