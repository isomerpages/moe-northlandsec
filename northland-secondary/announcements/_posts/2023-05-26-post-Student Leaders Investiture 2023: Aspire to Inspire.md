Our student leaders were formally recognised as representatives of the student leadership in Northland on 19 May. The ceremony started off with our Principal explaining the importance of leading and inspiring. This was followed by the swearing-in of the new Student Council and the affirmation of the CCA leaders. Our student leaders pledged to be Leaders who Dare, serving the community with pride and moral courage.
