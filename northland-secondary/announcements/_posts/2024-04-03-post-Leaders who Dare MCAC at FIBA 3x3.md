<p>Northland Secondary Schoolâ€™s MCAC was invited to put up a dance showcase
for the FIBA 3x3 Asia Cup 2024 held on 28 March 2024 at the OCBC Arena.</p>
<p>The heat was unrelenting, yet the dancers persevered to captivate the
crowd with a compelling street dance performance for the opening ceremony.
The atmosphere was electrifying and our energetic dancers definitely had
a ball (pun intended) that day! It such a memorable experience for our
dancers and we are grateful for this unique opportunity to showcase our
love for dance!</p>
<p>The performance was televised so do catch them in action on MeWatch (Channel
5)!</p>
