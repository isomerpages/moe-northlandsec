<p>Northland Secondary School celebrated Pongal on Friday, 19 January. Pongal
is a festival celebrated in South India over four days, by farmers who
give thanks to the Sun God for the blessings of a rich harvest and our
school seeks to educate our Northstars on the significance of Pongal in
our community and also stress on the importance about learning about other
cultures and practices.</p>
