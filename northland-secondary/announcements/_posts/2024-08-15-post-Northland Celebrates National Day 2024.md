<p>Our school celebrated Singapore’s 59th National Day on Thursday 8 August.
The theme for this year’s National Day is “Together, As One United People”,
which highlights the collective strength of our people and underscores
the importance of every citizen rallying together to shape our future and
uplift those around us. We started the day with the commemoration ceremony,
and then we headed on back to class to have fun dressing up our Singapore
mascots before heading to the hall to celebrate our nation’s birthday by
having performances, the Singapore Runway as well as singing our favourite
national day songs. #daretoshine</p>
