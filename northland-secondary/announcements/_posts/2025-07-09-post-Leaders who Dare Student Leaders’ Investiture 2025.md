<p>Friday 23 May witnessed the handing over the baton from one batch to another
in the 6th Student Leaders’ Investiture. This year’s theme, Defy Gravity,
sought to inspire our Northstars to rise beyond limits and believe in their
potential to lead with courage and purpose. #shine #shineforothers</p>
