Northland celebrated Youth Day this year with a series of activities on 7 July. Northstars got to come to school in their casual wear. The day started with the sale of special food items in the canteen and photo taking at the photo booths set up by Student Councillors, and it culminated to the celebratory concert which celebrated the days of being young and beautiful.
