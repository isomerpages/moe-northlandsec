<p>Our Secondary 2 Northstars participated in an engaging and interactive
STEM experience titled CodeQuest: Discover, Play, Create on Friday 2 May.
The event featured seven engaging and technology-enhanced STEM stations,
designed to provide students with an exciting hands-on introduction to
basic coding concepts. This session served as a lead-in to the drone programming
module scheduled in Term 4.</p>
