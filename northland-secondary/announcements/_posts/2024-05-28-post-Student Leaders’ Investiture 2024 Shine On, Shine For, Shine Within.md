<p>Last Friday, May 17, our school held the investiture ceremony for our
student leaders. The theme for this year's investiture is "Shine On, Shine
For, Shine Within."</p>
<p>"Shine On" encourages our Northstars to foster positive relationships
by celebrating each other's achievements and affirming each other's aspirations.
"Shine For" emphasises dedicating time and energy to serve their spheres
of influence and the community. Most importantly, "Shine Within" inspires
our Northstars to look within, focusing on their positive traits and strengths
to lead themselves and others in meaningful endeavours.</p>
<p>Shine Northstars! #daretoshine #shineforothers</p>
