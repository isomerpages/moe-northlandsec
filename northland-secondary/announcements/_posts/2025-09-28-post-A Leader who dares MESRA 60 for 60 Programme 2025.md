<p>Our Student Councillor, Nur Arianna Natasha Binte Norazman (2 Castor),
was nominated in April for the MESRA 60 for 60 Programme: Connecting Generations,
Charting Futures. This programme is a youth engagement initiative that
brings together students from schools all over Singapore, empowering them
to design and lead their own community projects. Through the programme,
Arianna has garnered not only skills but extended her networking beyond
the school. She mentioned that this programme is not only developmental
in nature but provide a greater awareness and appreciation towards the
community which many students do not get to experience often. She hopes
that this programme will continue for future student generations to come.</p>
