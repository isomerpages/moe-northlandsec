<p>The NOVA Trail is making learning come to live as a living classroom is
woven into the fabric of our Yishun neighbourhood. Each station is a location
of significance in Yishun, carefully chosen to connect directly with what
our Northstars study in school.</p>
<p>The NOVA Trail is a chance for Northstars to discover the stories and
science hidden in the places around them. At each stop, they were challenged
to notice, ask, and connect — not just to learn about Yishun, but to see
the subjects they learnt differently.</p>
<p>The N.O.V.A trail isn't about memorising facts; it’s about real-world
learning in our own backyard. By the end of the trail, Northstars walked
away not only knowing Yishun better, but also realising that every corner
of our neighbourhood can teach us something new.</p>
