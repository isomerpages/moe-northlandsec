<p>We are proud to announce that two of our Northstars received an award
for the ViaRT Green Art competition which took place last November. ViaRT
is an organisation that brings everyone together to make a positive impact
on sustainable living through art. The winners are Falesha from 4 Antares
and Shawki from 4 Epsilon (2024). Both Artworks will be showcased in the
Singapore Sustainable Gallery at the Marina Barrage at a later date. #shine</p>
