<p>The theme for this year’s Total Defence Day highlights Singapore’s readiness
and resilience in the face of crises and disruptions. Total Defence strengthens
our ability to respond to evolving threats and challenges, and everyone
has a role to play in keeping Singapore prepared. For the commemoration,
we curated a variety of hands-on learning experiences tailored to each
level and aligned with the corresponding defence pillars.</p>
