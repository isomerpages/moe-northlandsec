<p>The focus for Total Defence Day is on Singaporeansâ€™ readiness and resilience
in the face of crises and disruptions. Total Defence underpins our ability
to deal with the ever-evolving threats and challenges to Singapore. Every
Singaporean plays a part in our daily lives to ensure that Singapore is
prepared for crises and disruption. In the commemoration of Total Defence
Day, the school curated a range of hands-on learning experiences tailored
to each level, aligning with the respective defence pillar.</p>
