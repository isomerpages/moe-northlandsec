<p>This June, our Secondary 3 students embarked on a meaningful journey through
the School Work Attachment Programme (SWAP), gaining real-world insights
and learning beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>From writing with purpose at SPH Media, serving the community with SHINE
Youth and Children Services, witnessing care in action at Khoo Teck Puat
Hospital, empowering young leaders at Halogen Foundation, to exploring
heritage and creativity at the Children’s Museum, our students made the
most of every opportunity. 💼🌟</p>
<p>A huge well done to our students for stepping out of their comfort zones
and embracing this experience with enthusiasm and maturity. 👏</p>
<p>Our heartfelt thanks to our partner organisations for opening your doors
and investing in our students' growth. Here's to building brighter futures
together!</p>
