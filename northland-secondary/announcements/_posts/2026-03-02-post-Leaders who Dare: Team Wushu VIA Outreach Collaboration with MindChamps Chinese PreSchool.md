<p><strong>Leaders who Dare - Team Wushu VIA Outreach Collaboration with MindChamps Chinese PreSchool</strong>
</p>
<p>TeAm Wushu successfully completed their VIA Outreach with MindChamps Chinese
PreSchool. The team commends every member for stepping forward with courage
and purpose to mentor younger children—patiently guiding, encouraging and
sharing Wushu skills. They exemplified discipline, compassion and leadership,
culminating in a memorable combined Chinese New Year performance. In doing
so, they embodied the school’s values—Learners who Share, Citizens who
Care, and Leaders who Dare—showing growth as practitioners and community-minded
individuals. Their efforts strengthened the culture of service, leadership
and excellence and represented Northland Secondary School with pride.</p>
