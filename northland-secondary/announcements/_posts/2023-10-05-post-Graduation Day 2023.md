Friday, 27 September marked the end of the secondary school life for the class of 2023. Our Northstars took a trip down memory lane and witnessed how they have grown from boys to men and for the ladies; from girls to young ladies. Our School Leaders and Year Head also congratulated our graduates and exhorted them to continue learning and to cherish the friendships that are forged in Northland. As the song, Graduation, goes, 

As we go on, we remember 
All the times we had together
And as our lives change, come whatever
We will still be friends forever

All the best to your future endeavours, Northstars and may you continue to shine, wherever you are!
