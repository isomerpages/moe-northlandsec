They will also be exposed to various art forms to equip them with the skills to be able to express their ideas and experiences through art.</p>
<p>Through D&amp;T, students will develop empathy by developing a keen sense of observation of things around them and applying the design processes during designing. Students will be equipped with sketching skills to do product design during ideation.</p>
<p>Through Food and Consumer Education (FCE), students will gain awareness of the importance of health management and consumer education. Students will be equipped with basic food management and consumer rights and awareness skills to help them make good decisions in lives.</p>
