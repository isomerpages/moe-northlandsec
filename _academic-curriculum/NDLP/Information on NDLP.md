<p>At MOE&rsquo;s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning. This better enables students, at different stages of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the digital age.</p>
<p>One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a Personal Learning Device (PLD).</p>
<p>Through PDLP, Northland Secondary School aims to develop our students to be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Self-directed Learners who are intrinsically motivated to learn for life.</li>
<li>Connected and collaborative learners who learn and share through online networks.</li>
<li>Reflective learners who possess digital literacies and socio-emotional competencies to thrive in a digital environment.</li>
</ol>
