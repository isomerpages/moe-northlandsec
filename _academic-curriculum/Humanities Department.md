<p>The Humanities empower one to navigate the world we live in. Through an education in the Humanities, students learn to reason about being human and to ask questions about our world. They also learn to deal critically, logically and creatively with subjective, complex and often imperfect information.</p>
<p>At Northland Secondary School, the Humanities Department seeks to develop:<br><strong>Curiosity</strong><br><strong>Critical Thinking</strong><br><strong>Compassion&nbsp;in our students.</strong></p>
<p>We offer a range of subjects to develop our students into inquisitive and thinking Humanities learners. These include Social Studies, Geography, History. We also offer Retail Operations to our Upper Secondary Normal (Technical) students to better prepare them for progression to a related course of study in the Institute of Technical Education.</p>
