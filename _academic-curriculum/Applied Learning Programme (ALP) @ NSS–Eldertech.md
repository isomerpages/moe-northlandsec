<p>This year, our ALP has evolved to focus on how technology can be harnessed to improve the well-being of the elderly. In addition to learning about aging and the challenges that the elderly face, students will experience first-hand these difficulties using simulators that recreate the effects of aging such as deteriorating eyesight and hand tremors. With greater empathy for the challenges the elderly face, we hope to excite our students to equip our students to become active contributors and concerned citizens to care and support our elderly. Through Technology for Adaptive Aging, students develop technological solutions and assistive devices to help the elderly overcome some of the obstacles they face.</p>
