<p>The School Learning and Engagement Committee (SLE) seeks to create a culture of CARE amongst staff in NSS through professional learning platforms such as weekly Professional Development sessions, Departmental TTTs and Staff Seminars. The SLE coordinates and customises the school-based professional development across staff segments to strengthen staff capacity. Key Personnel and teacher representatives from various departments work collaboratively to conduct weekly workshops and sharing that are aligned to the school&rsquo;s strategic plan to grow the professional capital in NSS.</p>
