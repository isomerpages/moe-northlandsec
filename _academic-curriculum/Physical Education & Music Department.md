<p><strong>Physical education (PE)&nbsp;</strong>plays an important role in the holistic development of students by promoting the growth of body, mind and spirit, enabling students to experience the exhilarating sensation of well-being derived from being in an exciting match in a well-loved game, or simply from one’s regular exercise routine. Northland’s PE Curriculum articulates these outcomes through a two-pronged approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn to Play</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Shaping students’ character, instilling good values, cultivate positive attitudes, &amp; people skills&nbsp;<em><u>to prepare our students with skills for life.</u></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Play to Learn</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Providing students with programmes that deliver real-life experiential learning &amp; self-expression&nbsp;<em><u>to empower them with a lifelong love for physical activity and sports</u></em>.</p>
<p>The school delivers these outcomes by focusing on 4 areas defined under the school’s “F-A-S-T” PE Curriculum Map</p>
<p><strong>Fitness</strong><br>Developing students’ ability to take ownership of their fitness to lead a healthy life</p>
<p><strong>Attitudes</strong><br>Developing students’ character through sports and physical activity grounded on the school values of Respect, Responsibility and Resoluteness; developing a love for sport and physical activity</p>
<p><strong>Skills</strong><br>Developing students’ psychomotor competencies and skills so that they can participate in recreational competitive sports and outdoor pursuits</p>
<p><strong>Tactics</strong><br>Developing students’ problem-solving and understanding of games and sports classification and strategy so that they can participate in recreational competitive sports and outdoor pursuits</p>

<p>Northland delivers an exciting range of activities in PE</p>
