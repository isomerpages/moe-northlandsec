<p><strong>To help every N(T) student achieve success in school and be equipped to move beyond secondary school with a clear purpose in their lives. This is achieved by enhancing the quality of school experience for N(T) students through school-based curricular innovations involving both academic and co-curricular programmes, as well as collaboration with partners and external agencies.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>NT Learning Day</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the NT Curriculum, the NT Learning Day is a day where Secondary 1 to 3 NT students get to go on learning journeys and learn outside the classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objectives of the learning journeys are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ignite the joy of learning through experiential activities,</li>
<li>to learn and appreciate how subjects are applied in the real world.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Experience Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Programme (EIP) and MOE CAT A Elective Modules</strong></h4>
<p>Every year, secondary 2NT students will go through the Experience ITE Programme (EIP). In EIP, students are exposed to various taster modules from different schools. Some of the modules include western culinary, retail sales and mobile robotics.</p>
<p>Every year, both the secondary 2NT and 3NT students will experience the MOE CAT A Elective Modules (EMs). Students get to choose their preferred module and get a chance to study at ITE for four full days. The EMs help students to gain insights of studying in ITE, deepen their knowledge and skills in a subject matter and to gain one credit point upon completion.</p>
