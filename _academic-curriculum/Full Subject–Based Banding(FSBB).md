<p><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding @ Northland</strong></p>
<p>Northland Secondary School is proud to share that we will be implementing Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of Full SBB</strong></p>
<p>Full SBB is part of MOE&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to move towards one secondary school education, with many subject bands, for all our children. The goal is to recognise the different strengths and interests of our students and offer them an education with multiple pathways to build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life.</p>
<p>By 2024, all secondary schools will have implemented the following two aspects of Full SBB:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum;</li>
<li>Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What will Full SBB in Northland Secondary School in 2023 look like?</strong></p>
<p>All Secondary 1 students in 2023 will be able to offer subjects at the following bands:</p>

<p>Students will be able to take a range of subjects at G1, G2 and G3 based on their abilities, strengths and interests.</p>
<p><strong>All Secondary 1 students in 2023 will take the following subjects:</strong></p>

<p>Mixed form classes with common curriculum</p>
</td>
<td width="464">
<p>Students will be placed in mixed form classes starting from the&nbsp;<strong>Secondary 1 cohort of students entering Northland in 2023.</strong></p>
<p>Each form class will comprise students from different courses of study.&nbsp;Mixed form classes present great opportunities for students to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.</p>
<p>In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of &ldquo;common curriculum&rdquo; subjects, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. These common curriculum subjects are reflected in the table above.</p>
<p>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.</p>
<p>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will continue to be offered at G3 (current Express Level), G2 (current N(A) Level), and G1 (current N(T) Level). Students will be grouped according to their subject level for these subjects.</p>
<p>The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students&rsquo; PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each of these subjects.</p>

<p>Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2</p>
</td>
<td width="464">
<p>Currently, secondary school students can offer&nbsp;<strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Mathematics and Science&nbsp;</strong>at a more demanding level from the&nbsp;<strong>start of Secondary One</strong>&nbsp;based on students&rsquo; PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject.</p>
<p>After Secondary 1, students may also offer these subjects at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school. There will be various opportunities across the year for students to be offered the subject at a more or less demanding level.</p>
<p><strong>Our school will also provide Secondary 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is applicable to students who are in the Secondary 2 Normal (Academic) course from 2023, and students who are in the Normal (Technical) course from 2024.</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Criteria</u></strong></p>
<p>The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students&rsquo; aptitude for and interest in these subjects at&nbsp;Secondary 1.&nbsp;They should also possess a positive attitude towards learning and strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level.</p>
