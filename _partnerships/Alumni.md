<p>“Remember the source of the water when one drinks from it”. The school strongly believes that our alumni are powerful role models. When ex-students return to help their school, they carry with them the credibility of having been part of the school, and having succeeded in spite of the similar challenges that face current students. They also help to transmit the essence of school spirit, culture and beliefs from one generation to the next. The school is also proud of students who have done well in their tertiary education.&nbsp;</p>
