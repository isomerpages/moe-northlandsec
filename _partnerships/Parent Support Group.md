<p>The Parent Support Group (PSG) has always been a strong and invaluable
school partner, dedicating time and hard work to contribute to the school.&nbsp;
Our parents contribute by collaborating with various departments in some
of the school programmes. The PSG has worked with the Mother Tongue Languages
Department and CCE Committee to educate our Northstars about our culture.
Our PSG continues to play the important role of being the bridge between
the school and parents by supporting and serving our school and enlivening
and enriching our studentsâ€™ learning experiences.</p>
