<p>The Parent Support Group (PSG) has always been a strong and invaluable
school partner, dedicating time and hard work to contribute to the school.&nbsp;
Our parents contribute by collaborating with various departments in some
of the school programmes. The PSG helped to oversee the ‘Breakfast for
the Early Ones’, a Peer Support Leaders Programme. The PSG also worked
with the Mother Tongue Languages Department and CCE Committee to educate
our Northstars about our culture. Our PSG continues to play the important
role of being the bridge between the school and parents by supporting and
serving our school and enlivening and enriching our students’ learning
experiences.</p>
