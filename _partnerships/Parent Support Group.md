The Parent Support Group (PSG) has always been a strong and invaluable school partner, dedicating time and hard work to contribute to the school.&nbsp; Our parents contribute by collaborating with various departments in some of the school programmes. The PSG helped to oversee the ‘Breakfast for the Early Ones’, a Peer Support Leaders Programme. The PSG also worked with the Mother Tongue Languages Department and CCE Committee to educate our Northstars about our culture. Our PSG continues to play the important role of being the bridge between the school and parents by supporting and serving our school and enlivening and enriching our students’ learning experiences.<p></p>
