<p>he Parent Support Group (PSG) has always been a strong and invaluable school partner, dedicating time and hard work to contribute to the school.&nbsp; Despite safe distancing measures, our parents continued to contribute by collaborating with various departments in some of the school programmes. The PSG helped to oversee the &lsquo;Breakfast for the Early Ones&rsquo;, a Peer Support Leaders Programme. As part of Chinese New Year celebrations, the PSG worked with the Mother Tongue Department and initiated a Chinese cultural enrichment activity in the library.&nbsp; During Racial Harmony day, they educated our Northstars on the various traditional ethnic foods through Cultural Bites! Programme. Our PSG continues to play the important role of being the bridge between the school and parents by supporting and serving our school and enlivening and enriching our students&rsquo; learning experiences.</p>
