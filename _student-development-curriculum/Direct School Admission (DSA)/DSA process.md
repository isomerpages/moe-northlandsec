<p><strong><em>Important Considerations</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.</em>
