<p>Officially opened on 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;April this year, the Nebula Student Centre offers a friendly, relaxing atmosphere where students can unwind and socialise with friends and others who share similar interests after school curriculum hours.</p>
<p>The students can enjoy a game of Pool, Ping Pong, Air Hockey, Arcade game machine, PlayStation 5, Board games such Monopoly or Scrabble, Jenga or simply relax with their friends in the room.</p>
<p>Post exam activities were also organised to engage the students after completing their assessments, giving them opportunities to show their competitive side, as well as to just chill. The activities organised this year are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Air Hockey Competition</strong></p>
<p>In Term 2, we had our first Air Hockey competition opened to our Upper Sec students. To add excitement, the student participant had to partner with a teacher to spar with another teacher student pair. In Term 3, the Lower Sec students also had their chance to compete in the Air Hockey Competition - Teachers&rsquo; Day Special.</p>
