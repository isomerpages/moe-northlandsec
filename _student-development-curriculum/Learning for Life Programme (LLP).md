<h4><strong>Game for Life: Empowering our Active Sportsmen</strong></h4>
<p><em>Developing Social Emotional Competencies through Sports and Physical Activities</em></p>
<p>Our school&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>Learning for Life Programme,&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;<strong>Game for Life</strong>&rdquo; leverages sports and physical activity to prepare our Northstars for life, by imbuing them with strong social-emotional competencies grounded on our core values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience. Students will also be empowered with the passion, knowledge and skills to lead a life of healthy and sporting pursuits. In addition, students with sporting talent will be identified and progressively developed through exposure to competitive sports within and beyond the school.</p>
<p>The Game for Life programme at Northland Secondary is effected through a 2-prong approach articulated across the total curriculum:</p>
<p><strong>1. Play to Learn</strong>: Nurturing minds and strengthening vigour by&nbsp;developing students&rsquo; passion, knowledge and skills to lead a life of healthy and sporting pursuits and to fulfil their sporting potential through the (i) Physical Education, Outdoor Education and Co-curricular Activities and (ii) signature school programmes, such as SPARCLE Week.</p>
<p><strong>2. Learn to Play</strong>: Shaping character through an enacted, progressive and integrated curriculum centred on school and sporting values, attitudes and socio-emotional competencies.</p>
<p>The Activities: to Discover, to Develop &amp; to Deepen &ndash;</p>
