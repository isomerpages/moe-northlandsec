<p>The Students&rsquo; Council is the school&rsquo;s premier platform for developing confident student leaders who dare. The Council has strengthened its resolve to be the representatives of the student body, listening to the voices of Northstars. This year, the Council continued to seek feedback from the ground and issues surfaced by Northstars were analysed and shared with our School Leaders to improve the school. </p>
<p>The Council also continues to initiate and support school events, such as the inaugural Induction Ceremony for Secondary Ones. The Council has also grown in their ability to plan, articulate their proposals as well as implement events at school level. The Council EXCO members have shown maturity in their thinking and honed their collaborative competencies.</p>
<p>Our Student Councillors are cognisant of their leadership progress and development through their self-assessment of leadership and conversations with the Student Leadership teachers.&nbsp;Our Students&rsquo; Council will continue to work together with the student body to increase their own and the student body&rsquo;s voice and agency.</p>
