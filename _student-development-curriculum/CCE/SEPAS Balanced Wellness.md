<div><strong>Make time for family and friends</strong></div>
<div>We share our joys and sorrows with our family and friends. Look after your relationships! Spend some quality time together by taking part in common activities of interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Form new relationships&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>It is important to make new friends. To meet new people, join a new activity or simply start saying "Hi!" to students from other classes. Who knows, it may blossom into a lifelong friendship!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Offer support to others</strong></div>
<div>When your friend has a problem, how do you help? Sometimes, all you have to do is be a good listener. Show your friend that you are there to support him/her through the hard times. If the problem is too huge for your friend to handle, encourage him/her to share it with an adult -who may be able to help.</div>

<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Take Control!</strong></td>
<td colspan="4">
<div><strong>Don't be afraid to express your emotions appropriately.</strong></div>
<div>Experiencing and expressing emotions is a natural part of life. Expressing bad feelings makes it easier to let go and move on. However, think before you speak. Be clear in your communication about what is making you feel upset without blaming the other part. Move the conversation towards how such incidents could be avoided in the future.</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Talk to someone when you are feeling down.</strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Feeling sad or nervous is part of life.&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>Sharing your problem with someone you trust (e.g. your parent, school counsellor or teacher) will help you feel more supported.</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Have realistic expectations of yourself</strong></div>
<div>Sometimes, the goals that we set for ourselves may be so high that we cannot fulfil them. Recheck your goals and break down larger goals into smaller, more manageable tasks.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Surround yourself with positive thoughts&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>Is your glass half empty or half full? There is always more than one way of looking at a situation. Every time a negative thought comes to your mind, fight it with a positive thought! Keep positive energy in your life by surrounding yourself with positive people.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Don't let set-backs get you down</strong></div>
<div>Learn from real-life resilience heroes and find out what your Bounce Back factor is.&nbsp;</div>

<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Take Control!</strong></td>
<td colspan="4">
<div><strong>Eat breakfast!&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>Skipping breakfast is an unwise decision as it can lead to overeating later in the day.</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Eat sensibly&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>Learn more about what you eat and how it will affect your energy and mood. Bear in mind that moderation is key.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Get enough rest&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>Most people require 7 to 8 hours of sleep each day in order to function properly. Insufficient sleep leads to a decrease in motivation, concentration and academic performance. Keep to regular bed times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Exercise regularly</div>
<div>Exercise is a powerful antidote to stress. It is easy to make exercise part of your life. Take the stairs instead of elevator and walk if the distance between bus stops is short.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Avoid harmful behaviors&nbsp;</div>
<div>Smoking, drug-taking and other risky behaviours have long-term negative effects on our health. Do not engage in such behaviors!&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Visit the doctor when necessary</div>
<div>
<div>Your body will show signs when you are about to fall ill, such as having a sore throat. Learn to recognise these signs. Visit the doctor when necessary. &nbsp;</div>

<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Take Control!</strong></td>
<td colspan="4">
<div><strong>Find interest in your work</strong></div>
<div>Studying is not just about passing an exam. It is about learning more about the world around you. Look for new and interesting things to take away from each lesson.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Manage your time well</strong></div>
<div>A planned schedule ensures that you put aside enough time for the different tasks according to their level of importance, putting you in control of your time. Prepare for your classes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You &nbsp;can make lessons more useful by preparing before classes. Reading your textbook beforehand makes it easier for you to understand what is being taught. Write down anything you do not understand and come prepared to ask questions in class. Such active learning will help you remember better.</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Be a well-rounded student</strong></div>
<div>You don't have to be in the classroom in order to learn! Take time to explore the ongoing activities in school and develop new areas of your life.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Take time to unwind</strong></div>
<div>Reserve time in your schedule to unwind. Do something you enjoy, get some exercise or chill with a friend. Let your mind rest! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
