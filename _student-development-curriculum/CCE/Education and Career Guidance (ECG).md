<p><strong><u>D.A.R.E. (Daring, Adaptable and Resilient Enterprisers)&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;(For Sec 1 students)<br /></strong>In NSS, the DARE programme aims to prepare our Secondary One students for life beyond school with an emphasis on an understanding of entrepreneurship. We believe there is an increasing need for our future generations to be able to quickly analyse complex issues, identify problems and gaps, develop new ideas, seize opportunities and, most importantly, to have the entrepreneurial dare to take action. DARE serves as a platform for students to learn and practise these skills through the creation of a product as well as generate possible revenue for the school community.</p>

<h4><strong>NSS Career Talk for Secondary Twos</strong></h4>

<p>Through the talk, our Northstars got to understand the workings of the various industries, and the competencies and qualifications needed to work in these fields. Our speakers were alumni of Northland Secondary School and North View Secondary School, who keenly shared on their professions, and urged the young ones to reach for their aspirations.</p>
