<p>Our Internationalisation Programme develops Northstars to possess a global outlook by providing them with opportunities to engage with foreign schools. This year, NSS hosted four groups of educators and students from Hainan, Wu Yuan He School and Shiyan Secondary School. Our SG Ambassadors organised a cultural immersion tour and brought the guests around the neighbourhood. The Hainan students also joined our SG Ambassadors in their classroom lessons to get an authentic experience of Singapore&rsquo;s education system.</p>
