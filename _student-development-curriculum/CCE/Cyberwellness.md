<p>Cyber-wellness refers to the positive well-being of internet users. Cyber-wellness lessons enable our students to understand the norms of appropriate, responsible behaviour with regard to technology use as well as knowledge, skills and values on how to protect oneself in the cyber world. Northstars are taught the following 3-step process to explore cyber-wellness issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sense</strong>: being able to sense the risks of harmful online behaviours and knowing how to manage such risks to protect themselves from the dangers</li>
<li><strong>Think</strong>: developing the ability to respond to new encounters in cyberspace</li>
<li><strong>Act</strong>: translating their understanding into actions that will keep them safe online</li>
</ul>
