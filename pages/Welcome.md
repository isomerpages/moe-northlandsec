<p>Congratulations on your posting to Northland Secondary School (NSS) to commence your secondary school education, as a Northstar. It will be a new phase of your development and we are happy to welcome you as part of our NSS family.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s Sec 1 registration will be carried out in a hybrid mode.</p>
<p>During the&nbsp;<strong>Sec 1 Registration day (23 December 2022)</strong>, there will be</p>
<ul>
<li>A welcome address by our Principal</li>
<li>A briefing on National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</li>
<li>A Meet-&amp;-Greet with our Class Mentors</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not need to be physically present in our school on that day as registration will take place online via webinar and&nbsp;only selected students and their parents&nbsp;will be required to attend a face-to-face briefing in Northland Secondary School.</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;Class Mentors&nbsp;will contact you/your parent/guardian&nbsp;on the day prior to the Sec 1 Registration,&nbsp;to welcome you officially and to provide some general information on administration matters.</p>
