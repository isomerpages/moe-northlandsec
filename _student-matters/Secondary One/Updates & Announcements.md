<h4><strong>Secondary 1 CCA Orientation</strong></h4>
<p>It was the first CCA day for our new Secondary One Northstars and our students were given exposure to the various CCAs that our school has to offer. Our Secondary Ones observed their seniors hone their skills in their respective Co-Curriculum Activities (CCAs). With a wide array of Sports, Uniformed Groups, Performance Arts and Clubs to choose from, our Secondary Ones were in for an enjoyable time. This orientation serves to provide Northstars with insights to the various CCAs and allows them to choose one which would feed their interest and passion.</p>
