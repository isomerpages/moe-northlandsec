<p><strong>Transiting with Confidence &amp; Respect</strong></p>
<p>SPARCLE 1 for Secondary 1s is targeted at helping our Northstars understand themselves and understand the idea of being a person for others. During the week, Northstars attended an exciting Outdoor Adventure Learning Journey, participated in a Scavenger Hunt and learnt to be socially responsible citizens by actively participating in Values in Action.</p>
