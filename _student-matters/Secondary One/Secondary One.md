<p>In Secondary One, the focus is on enabling our students to be able to&nbsp;<strong>transit with confidence and respect</strong>&nbsp;from their primary school education. We envision all our Northstars to be respectful individuals who demonstrate mutual respect to everyone around them. The expanded academic curriculum in secondary school places new demands on students, so they are taught to pick up good habits and work ethics that will enable them to function more independently. Through student development areas such as Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), students will also learn to manage their emotions and behaviour better, and learn to collaborate well with others in their schooling journey together.</p>
