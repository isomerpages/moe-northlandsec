What is the secret to success? For some of our top students, the secret is to start revision early and practice good time management.

On Thursday 11 January, graduating students from Northland Secondary School received their GCE O-level results. All of them were warmly welcomed by our School Leaders and Year Head. Our top performers paid tribute to their teachers and parents for their tremendous support. Phung Khanh Linh from 4 Orion is grateful to her aunt for giving her encouragement whenever she felt down. Our students have also set their sights to going to the polytechnic for their post-secondary education. Congratulations Northstars for your stellar performances!
