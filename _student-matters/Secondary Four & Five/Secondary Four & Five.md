In Secondary Four, the focus will be on developing students to **pursue excellence with grit**. Where learning is concerned, students would be expected to aim high and strive to produce quality work in assignments and demonstrate mastery in their academic work. As they prepare to embark upon their post-secondary school options, we would also want them to think about how they can make a positive change to the community.
