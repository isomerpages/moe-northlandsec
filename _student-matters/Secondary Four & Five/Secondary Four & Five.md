<p>In Secondary Four, the focus will be on developing students to&nbsp;<strong>pursue excellence with grit</strong>. Where learning is concerned, students would be expected to aim high and strive to produce quality work in assignments and demonstrate mastery in their academic work. As they prepare to embark upon their post-secondary school options, we would also want them to think about how they can make a positive change to the community. As&nbsp;<strong>Leaders who Dare</strong>, students would be given opportunities to take on key portfolios as student leaders, and explore the five facets of Kouzes and Posner&rsquo;s Leadership Challenge and see how they can best exert positive influence to their peers and juniors under their charge.</p>
