<p><strong>SPARCLE 1 Week 2019 - Secondary 4E5N Graduation Package</strong></p>
<p>Northstars went on a learning journey to NYP to gain exposure to the various courses they offer and have hands-on experience in some of the courses they are interested in. In addition, they visited YIJC and experienced how it is like to be in a junior college. They also benefitted from sharings by our Alumni who talked about transition to JC and tertiary education. As part of their Values-In-Action (VIA), our Northstars planned and visited an elderly home and a preschool to bring some joy to the elderly and the young children.&nbsp;</p>
