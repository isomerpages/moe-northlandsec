<p>In Secondary Three, the focus will be to nurture students to&nbsp;<strong>stay resilient&nbsp;</strong>in the face of life&rsquo;s challenges. Progressing from Lower Secondary to Upper Secondary,&nbsp; we would like to inspire students&rsquo; learning and encourage them to take greater ownership of their academic learning. At the same time, we would also want to nurture our students to be exemplary stewards of our community in future.&nbsp; Key programmes such as Northland&rsquo;s Overseas Values-in-Action (NOVIA) are key in broadening students&rsquo; outlook, to see how they can become&nbsp;<strong>Citizens who Care</strong>&nbsp;not just about their immediate needs, but also of others and society&rsquo;s.</p>
