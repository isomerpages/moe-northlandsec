<p><strong>Staying Resilient</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>In SPARCLE 1 for Secondary 3s, we invite our students to think about their greater purpose and impact and explore opportunities for their future careers. During the week, Northstars attended an exciting Outdoor Adventure Learning Journey, set up their profile for MySkillsFuture and learnt to be socially responsible citizens by actively participating in Values in Action.</p>
