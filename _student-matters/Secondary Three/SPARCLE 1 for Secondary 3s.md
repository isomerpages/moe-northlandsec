<p><strong>Staying Resilient</strong><strong><br></strong></p>

In SPARCLE 1 for Secondary 3s, we invite our students to think about their greater purpose and impact and explore opportunities for their future careers. During the week, Northstars attended an exciting camp at Home Team NS Bukit Batok and took part in activities like rock-climbing and kayaking.
