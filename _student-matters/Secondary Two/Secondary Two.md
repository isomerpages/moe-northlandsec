<p>In Secondary Two, the focus will be to enable students to&nbsp;<strong>make responsible decisions</strong>. We would like them to learn about how to be better at decision-making through considering deeper issues such as their values, ethics, trade-offs and the consequences of their actions. Using a continuous process of reflection, students will become&nbsp;<strong>Learners who Share</strong>&nbsp;and can help support their peers both academically and emotionally to shine as Northstars. Through our signature programmes of SPARCLE and multiple Education and Career Guidance (ECG) engagements with both students and their parents throughout the year, students will be able to make informed decisions about their future.</p>
