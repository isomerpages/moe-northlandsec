<p><strong>Making Responsible Choices</strong></p>

SPARCLE 1 for Secondary 2s is geared towards the growth of self and the idea of making important choices about who they want to be. During the week, Northstars attended an exciting camp in Camp Christine, participating in confidence-building activities like the BP Eco Challenge and team-building activities like building their own tents.
