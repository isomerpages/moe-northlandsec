<p><em>Northland Secondary School's Netball has played a vital role in my secondary school life and shaped the person I am today. It has certainly taught me many values, which I continue to hold on to up till today. One of the most important takeaway from my experience in NSS netball is the value of perseverance. NSS netball taught me to persevere throughout my secondary school journey, as I tried to juggle my studies and netball training. My caring school netball coach and teachers gave me a lot of encouragement as I was going through many ups and downs during that time. They helped me build my confidence and even made me the Captain of my team. I'm grateful to Northland Secondary school for paving the way for me to pursue my Netball passion and for helping me build good values.&nbsp; Their efforts enabled me to gain entry into Anderson Junior Colleague through the JAE programme.</em></p>

<p><em>My first international tournament was the YOG Qualifiers in 2018. I was 15 years old and the youngest player in the tournament. Following that tournament, I was the&nbsp;Captain&nbsp;of the AHF cup held in Australia. My first Senior men's games were the international hockey test series in 2019. &nbsp; Northland Secondary School was the foundation of my sporting career. Northland Hockey has a great winning history, and I was glad to be part of the journey. The coaches and staff in Northland always motivated me to do my best in sports and studies. Northland Hockey has taught me juggling schoolwork and&nbsp; competition, which also taught me about time management skills. In addition, we went for many camps and overseas trips. All these have benefited us in many ways, both individually and as a Team. This bonding&nbsp; helped us improve&nbsp; our teamwork on the pitch and made us lifelong friends off the pitch. The best part of my time in Northland was going through ups and downs with my teammates. The friendships I forged during this journey has lasted me till this day, and I'm sure, for many more years to come.</em></p>

<p><em>Northland’s Hockey and Floorball programmes have moulded me to be a better player. They also always remind me to be on the right track morally, especially when I put on the school jersey. The programmes helped sharpen my skills as I saw steady improvements on the pitch. Northland also provided me with platforms to travel and compete overseas. Through constant honing of skills and character, it eventually benefited me by enabling me to get into polytechnic using Hockey/Floorball through Direct School Admission Scheme. I also attribute a big part of my development to my dedicated coaches and teachers who constantly supported us.</em></p>
