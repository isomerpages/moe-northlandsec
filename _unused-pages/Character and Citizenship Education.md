<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p>Our school-based CCE programmes aim to develop our Northstars as future-ready&nbsp;<strong>Learners who Share, Citizens who Care</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Leaders who Dare</strong>, by inculcating values and helping them develop competencies for the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through CCE, students learn to be responsible to family and community, and understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation, by exploring their&nbsp;<strong>Identity</strong>, their&nbsp;<strong>Relationships</strong>&nbsp;with the people around them and the&nbsp;<strong>Choices</strong>&nbsp;they make. These three big ideas are explored through the various domains of Self, Family, School, Community, Nation and ultimately the World.</p>

<p>In weekly CCE lessons, our Northstars explore these ideas contextualised in the areas of V<strong>alues-in-Action (VIA), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber-wellness Education (CW), National Education&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;Sexuality Education (SEd).&nbsp;</strong></p>
