<p>Congratulations on your posting to Northland Secondary School (NSS) to
commence your secondary school education, as a Northstar. It will be a
new phase of your development and we are happy to welcome you as part of
our NSS family.</p>
<p>This year's Sec 1 registration will be held via webinar/online mode.</p>
<p>During the <strong>Sec 1 Registration day (23 December 2025)</strong>,
there will be</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A welcome address
by our Principal and Sec 1 AYH</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A briefing on
National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A SBB briefing
for G1 and G2 students</p>
<p>You do not need to be physically present in our school on that day as
registration will take place online via webinar.</p>
<p>Our Class Mentors will contact you/your parent/guardian on the day prior
to the Sec 1 Registration, to welcome you officially and to provide some
general information on administration matters.</p>
