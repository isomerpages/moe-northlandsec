<p>This lesson aims to help students think critically about gender stereotypes that exist in our society in the contexts of career and family (e.g. males typically perceived as main breadwinners and females typically perceived as main caregivers in the family), and the impact of these stereotypes on individuals. Students will learn to be aware of possible gender stereotypes that may affect one&rsquo;s family and future decisions. They will also learn to reframe their perspectives and not judge others based on their own or others&rsquo; values and principles, with regard to gender stereotypes.</p>

<ul>

<li>know that imposing gender stereotypes on oneself and others can limit one&rsquo;s experiences, cause harm to the self-esteem of oneself and others and should be avoided</li>

<p>This lesson focuses on building a positive relationship with one&rsquo;s partner in a marriage.

Students will learn that what really matters to sustain and maintain a long-term romantic relationship leading to marriage is understanding the other person&rsquo;s perspective and effectively communicating with each other.&nbsp;</p>
