<p><strong><em><u>eTeens</u></em></strong><strong><u>&nbsp;Programme</u></strong>:</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;is a programme developed by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection from a health perspective.&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;is conducted in two segments &ndash; a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme.</li>
<li>Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to sex and negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves their family. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages.The desired outcome of the&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;programme is that students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>At Northland Secondary School, the&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;programme will be implemented as follows in 2023:</strong></p>
